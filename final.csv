You can install ESR version to separate folder so you are able continue using both versions. I haven't tested that version so there could be some minor issues. I recommend using my older version files. [Maybe something like v115.x - v117.x should work fine.]( 1. Download the portable or installation file from [github.com/MicaForEveryone]( 2. Install the extra files it asks you to install. And run the program. 3. At the bottom left corner press `Add Rule` -> `Add Process Rule`, type `firefox` -> `add`. 4. On the left panel select and open `firefox` section. Change Mica to `Acrylic` for better blur effect. 5. Dont forget to download my css file `acrylic_micaforeveryone.css` from `EXTRA THEMES` and put it inside `Chrome` folder (and base files from Installation guide above). 6. Remove and dont use any other min-max-close window button files. 7. Expermental:warning: In MicaForEveryone settings `firefox` section enable `Blur Behind` so when the window is not active it will still be blurred. :shield: Last Updates `v2.7.4` - `22/12/2023` - Tested on Firefox v121.0 - Fix Linux context menu buttons (recent). - Context menu back and forward buttons now dimmed when not active (recent). `v2.7.3` - `22/12/2023` - Tested on Firefox v121.0 - Fix min/max/close buttons for Firefox beta, nightly (recent). - Fix buttons size in context menu.

firefox-gnome-theme,rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme,3248,"['CSS', 'Shell', 'JavaScript']","['gnome', 'theme', 'firefox', 'userchrome', 'css']","# Firefox GNOME theme []( []( []( **A GNOME theme for Firefox** This theme follows latest GNOME Adwaita style. > [!WARNING] > ### Disclaimer: > Be aware that this theme might do things that are not supported by upstream Firefox. If you face an issue while using this theme, report it here first or test if it is reproducible in vanilla Firefox. > > If you are a software distribution maintainer, please do not ship this changes by default to your users unless you made extremely clear that they are using a modified version of Firefox UI. ## Description This is a bunch of CSS code to make Firefox look closer to GNOME's native apps. ### Getting in Touch Matrix room: [#firefox-gnome-theme:matrix.org]( ### Firefox versions support The `master` branch of this repo supports the current Firefox stable release `126`. Theme versions compatible with older Firefox releases are preserved as git tags. We also have the `beta` and `nightly` branches for fixes only applicable to the current Firefox beta and nightly versions. # Installation ## Package managers ### Arch Linux 1. Install the [AUR package]( `firefox-gnome-theme` 2. Follow the instructions at `cat /usr/share/doc/firefox-gnome-theme/INSTALL.md` ## One command install with curl To install this theme, you can run this command, which uses *curl* to download a script that will also download the latest released version of the theme (not the master version) and run the **auto-install** script for you. > **Warning**: Always be careful when running scripts from the Internet. ```sh curl -s -o- | bash ``` ## Installation scripts If you want to use other version of the theme than the stable one you can manually download the theme and run its install scripts. First you need to grab a fresh copy of the theme repository by cloning it with git. 1. Clone this repo and enter folder: ```sh git clone cd firefox-gnome-theme ``` 2. Checkout a git branch or tag if needed, otherwise use `master` and ignore this step. ```sh git checkout beta # Set beta branch git checkout v78.1 # Set v78.1 tag ``` This theme provides two installation scripts in addition to the curled one. ### Auto install script This script will look for Firefox profiles from various known locations (`~/.mozilla/firefox/`, Flatpak, Snap, etc) and install the theme in each one. It will also enable a color variant for your GTK theme if it exists. You can execute it by running: ```sh ./scripts/auto-install.sh ``` ### Manual install script This script will only install the theme into the profiles found in the default Firefox folder `~/.mozilla/firefox/`. The script accepts various flags to change its behavior. Here are some examples of how to use it: ```sh ./scripts/install.sh # Standard ./scripts/install.sh -p pc8577yz.default-release # Only install in a profile named pc8577yz.default-release ./scripts/install.sh -f ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox # Flatpak ./scripts/install.sh -f ~/snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox #Snap ``` #### Script options - `-f ` *optional* - Set custom Firefox folder path, for example `~/.mozilla/icecat/`. - Default: `~/.mozilla/firefox/` - `-p ` *optional* - Set custom profile name, for example `e0j6yb0p.default-nightly`. - Default: All the profiles found in the firefox folder - `-t ` *optional* - Set the colors used in the theme. - Default: Adwaita. - Options: `adwaita`, `maia`. Advanced notes ### Advanced notes If you want to checkout the theme version tag matching you Firefox version you can run: ```sh git checkout v$(firefox --version | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d '.' -f 1) # Using Firefox version ``` Manual installation ## Manual installation 1. Go to `about:support` in Firefox. 2. Application Basics > Profile Directory > Open Directory. 3. Open directory in a terminal. 4. Create a `chrome` directory if it doesn't exist: ```sh mkdir -p chrome cd chrome ``` 5. Clone this repo to a subdirectory: ```sh git clone ``` 6. Create single-line user CSS files if non-existent or empty (at least one line is needed for `sed`): ```sh [[ -s userChrome.css ]] || echo >> userChrome.css [[ -s userContent.css ]] || echo >> userContent.css ``` 7. Import this theme at the beginning of the CSS files (all `@import`s must come before any existing `@namespace` declarations): ```sh sed -i '1s/^/@import ""firefox-gnome-theme\/userChrome.css"";\n/' userChrome.css sed -i '1s/^/@import ""firefox-gnome-theme\/userContent.css"";\n/' userContent.css ``` 8. Symlink preferences file: ```sh cd .. # Go back to the profile directory ln -fs chrome/firefox-gnome-theme/configuration/user.js user.js ``` 9. Restart Firefox. 10. Open Firefox customization panel and move the new tab button to headerbar. 11. Be happy with your new gnomish Firefox. ## Required Firefox preferences We provide a **user.js** configuration file in `configuration/user.js` that enable some preferences required by this theme to work. You should already have this file installed if you followed one of the installation methods, but in any case be sure this preferences are enabled under `about:config`: - `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` This preference is required to load the custom CSS in Firefox, otherwise the theme wouldn't work. - `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` This preference is required to recolor the icons, otherwise you will get black icons everywhere. > For other non essential preferences checkout `configuration/user.js`. ## Updating You can follow the installation script steps again to update the theme. ## Uninstalling 1. Go to your profile folder. (Go to `about:support` in Firefox > Application Basics > Profile Directory > Open Directory) 2. Remove `chrome` folder. 3. Remove the unwanted preferences from your `user.js` inside your profile folder. The install script append the needed prefs in that file, you can check what preferences does it append by checking `configuration/user.js` in this repo. ## Enabling optional features Optional features can be enabled by creating new `boolean` preferences in `about:config`. 1. Go to the `about:config` page 2. Type the key of the feature you want to enable 3. Set it as a `boolean` and click on the add button 4. Restart Firefox ### Features - **Hide single tab** `gnomeTheme.hideSingleTab` Hide the tab bar when only one tab is open. > **Note:** You should move the new tab button out of the tabbar or it will be hidden when there is only one tab. You can rearrange the toolbars doing a right-click on any toolbar and selecting ""Customize Toolbar"". > **Note 2:** This feature doesn't work when tabs are hidden, like when using the Simple Tab Groups extension. In this case, there's no way to tell from CSS that there's only one visible tab. - **Normal width tabs** `gnomeTheme.normalWidthTabs` Use normal width tabs as default Firefox. - **Swap tab close button position** `gnomeTheme.swapTabClose` By default the tab close buttons follows the position of the window controls, this preference reverts that behavior. - **Bookmarks toolbar under tabs** `gnomeTheme.bookmarksToolbarUnderTabs` Move Bookmarks toolbar under tabs. - **Active tab contrast** `gnomeTheme.activeTabContrast` Add more contrast to the active tab. - **Close only selected tabs** `gnomeTheme.closeOnlySelectedTabs` Show the close button on the selected tab only. - **System icons** `gnomeTheme.systemIcons` Use system theme icons instead of Adwaita icons included by theme. > **Note:** This feature has a [known color bug](#icons-color-broken-with-system-icons). - **Symbolic tab icons** `gnomeTheme.symbolicTabIcons` Make all tab icons look kinda like symbolic icons. - **Hide WebRTC indicator** `gnomeTheme.hideWebrtcIndicator` Hide redundant WebRTC indicator since GNOME provides their own privacy icons in the top right. - **Hide unified extensions button** `gnomeTheme.hideUnifiedExtensions` Hide unified extensions button from the navbar, you can also use `extensions.unifiedExtensions.enabled` instead, which is only going to work till Firefox 111. - **Drag window from headerbar buttons** `gnomeTheme.dragWindowHeaderbarButtons` Allow dragging the window from headerbar buttons. > **Note:** This feature is BUGGED. It can activate the button with unpleasant behavior. - **Tabs as headerbar** `gnomeTheme.tabsAsHeaderbar` Place the tabs on the top of the window, and use the tabs bar to hold the window controls, like Firefox's standard tab bar. > **Note:** Enabling with `gnomeTheme.hideSingleTab` will replace the single tab with a title bar. ### Extensions support We also have optional features to enable support for some Firefox extensions. > **Be aware that extensions support are maintained by the community, so requests to support new extensions are not allowed and the included ones could get broken until someone shows up to fix them.** - **Tab center reborn support** `gnomeTheme.extensions.tabCenterReborn` Enable the vertical tab trough the extension : [Tab Center Reborn]( > **Note:** You also need to copy the contents of the file `configuration/extensions/tab-center-reborn.css` into the settings page of Tabcenter-reborn..\ > **Note2:** You can also maintain the vertical tab always open with `gnomeTheme.extensions.tabCenterReborn.alwaysOpen` > **Note2:** You can disable animation by disabling animation into the extension and adding the flags `gnomeTheme.extensions.tabCenterReborn.animationDisabled` ## Known bugs ### CSD have sharp corners See upstream [bug]( #### Wayland fix: 1. Go to the `about:config` page 2. Search for the `layers.acceleration.force-enabled` preference and set it to true. 3. Now restart Firefox, and it should look good! #### X11 fix: 1. Go to the `about:config` page 2. Type `mozilla.widget.use-argb-visuals` 3. Set it as a `boolean` and click on the add button 4. Now restart Firefox, and it should look good! ### Icons color broken with System icons Icons might appear black where they should be white on some systems.

AnuPpuccin,AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin,1845,"['CSS', 'SCSS', 'Makefile']","['obsidian', 'obsidian-md', 'theme']","AnuPpuccin Personal theme for Obsidian :3 Voted Best Theme in Gems of the Year 2022 awards Notice AnuPpuccin is currently on hiatus!I have been busy with endsems and projects, thus I haven't been able to dedicate time to fix bugs and issues and I'm really sorry for that . Thank you for your understanding! ## Preface Please do note that I've made this theme for myself, and it may not fit your use cases. However, I've made most of the configuration completely optional so that the experience remains as close to vanilla if you choose to do so. Most of the in-application variables are recolored so that your custom snippets can be used easily with the theme. This theme makes heavy use of the style settings plugin, which controls most of the features in the theme. The theme is perfectly usable even without style settings, but it's only a fraction of what it actually is with the plugin. I will respond to feature/code removal only if there is substantial evidence of it being a direct copy of the original code and not just a simple imitation. (Please keep this point in mind before accusing me of being a low-effort theme developer.) ### If you like my theme: I've made this theme primarily for my own purposes and it's completely free, but if you do like it enough to consider throwing a few coins in my hat, here's a link. ## License AnuPpuccin is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license which allows you to modify the code freely, however the Copyright and license notices must be preserved in your CSS. If you redistribute a part of my code, please credit my theme in your CSS file, and specify which code you are using. **Please keep my Buy Me a Coffee link in your README if you do so.** Installation Normal Installation Go to your theme folder (.obsidian/themes) and run: git clone Updating Go to your AnuPuccin folder (.obsidian/themes/Anuppuccin) and run: git pull Building Clone the github repo and run sass src/base.scss theme.css in the root folder. ## Community Contributions AnuPpuccin has a [Discussions]( page dedicated to snippets that add a personal touch to your obsidian setup. If you want to share your customizations, feel free to do so! ## Features ### Custom palette The theme supports various palettes (5 in the base theme and even more if you use the extended colorschemes snippet) which include many popular colorschemes such as Catppuccin and Dracula. These are heavily integrated into the theme as they are directly used to stylize various UI elements. ### Layouts Anuppuccin currently supports 2 layout variants. ### Rainbow folders The theme comes with a toggleable rainbow folder snippet which color-codes your folders as per their order in the filesystem. It's great if you need to easily distinguish between folders or if you want to make your vault look a bit prettier (Both in my case :P) #### Full rainbow theme This snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to the first layer of the root directory, aka only direct children. You can choose if it applies to root files as well and customise the indentation border color. #### Simple rainbow theme This snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to every folder in your filesystem, and the order is determined by the children's place in the parent folder. You can toggle if the recolor applies to the title, the collapse border, the collapse icon and you can append a small icon to the folder title as well. ### Alternate tabs ### Customisable Decorations Bold and italic colors can be toggled on and off and can be customised according to the palette as well. ### Callouts The theme comes with many custom callout styles (which can be toggled so they won't interfere with your own callout snippet). The snippet also includes support for using the colors of your selected palette which means that the callouts don't ever look out of place :) If you use the admonition plugin/have custom callout colors, they won't be affected by the recolor as it only targets vanilla callouts. However, you can make them use AnuPpuccin's palette to support dynamic per-palette theming. ### Custom checkboxes & Speech bubbles Anuppuccin's custom checkboxes try to mimic the original checkbox design as much as possible, while still being optional incase you want to use your own checkbox snippet. Speech bubbles have been provided which are useful for language learners and RPG vault users alike.Custom checkboxes have been designed to match those provided by the Primary theme for ease of migration and consistency. | Syntax | Description | | ------- | --------------- | | `- [ ]` | Unchecked | | `- [x]` | Checked | | `- [>]` | Rescheduled | | `- [<]` | Scheduled | | `- [!]` | Important | | `- [-]` | Cancelled | | `- [/]` | In Progress | | `- [?]` | Question | | `- [*]` | Star | | `- [n]` | Note | | `- [l]` | Location | | `- [i]` | Information | | `- [I]` | Idea | | `- [S]` | Amount | | `- [p]` | Pro | | `- [c]` | Con | | `- [b]` | Bookmark | | `- [""]` | Quote | | `- [u]` | Up | | `- [d]` | Down | | `- [w]` | Win | | `- [k]` | Key | | `- [f]` | Fire | | `- [0]` | Speech bubble 0 | | `- [1]` | Speech bubble 1 | | `- [2]` | Speech bubble 2 | | `- [3]` | Speech bubble 3 | | `- [4]` | Speech bubble 4 | | `- [5]` | Speech bubble 5 | | `- [6]` | Speech bubble 6 | | `- [7]` | Speech bubble 7 | | `- [8]` | Speech bubble 8 | | `- [9]` | Speech bubble 9 | ### Colorful Frames Adapted from Kepano's Minimal theme, colorful frames add some pop to your vault by displaying your accent color on the top-most bar. ### Simplified markdown embeds Markdown embeds have an alternate styling with an animated variant which can be toggled globally using style settings or individually using alt names for embeds, for example: `![[embed|alt-name]]` | Embed style | Alt name | | ----------- | -------- | | Seamless | seamless | ## Colorschemes used **Note**: Colorschemes that aren't in the base theme can be used through the [extended colorschemes]( snippet. **Important**: Some colorschemes have been been modified to fit the Catppuccin color value style, which means there will be some changes made to make the theme feel more natural. | Theme | Light Mode | Dark Mode | Extra Notes | | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | [Atom]( | Yes | Yes | Accent value is hardcoded into the theme. | | [Catppuccin]( | Yes | Yes | There are 4 variants of the dark theme, namely: Frappe, Macchiato, Mocha and Mocha Old.The light theme is called Latte. | | Coffee | No | Yes | Custom colorscheme | | [Biscuit]( | Yes | Yes | - | | [Everforest]( | Yes | Yes | - | | [Dracula]( | No | Yes | - | | [Gruvbox]( | Yes | Yes | - | | [Nord]( | Yes | Yes | A custom darker variant of the dark theme is included as well.

You can buy Kepano a coffee here: ### Recommended Fonts - **Interface**: [Overpass]( - **Text**: [Rubik]( - **Headings**: [Noto Serif]( ### Special thanks to: - [Paul Ryley]( for countless contributions to the theme and amazing sense of design in general. - [Chuck Harmston]( for his amazing alternate tabs snippet. - [melnhh]( and Lunairee for their amazing colorschemes. - [EdualcLaiv]( for porting Royal Velvet to AnuPpuccin. - [xotea]( for theming framework tweaks. - [raisabelatrix]( for [rainbow tags]( variables. ## Credits and Acknowledgements - [@kepano's]( [Minimal]( for the inspiration for [colorful frames]( and partial inspiration for style settings menus design, as well as style settings for the Minimal Cards snippet - [@ceciliamay's]( [Primary]( for inspiration for [custom checkboxes]( and [floating vault title]( - [@SlRvb]( for [ITS]( frontmatter styling inspiration. - [@Akifyss]( for their [border theme]( layout design.","162, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, enhancement, bug, wontfix, question, invalid, help wanted, good first issue, duplicate, documentation, Feature Removal"

If you don't like Jekyll, you may directly edit and use the HTML version. ## Customizing ### Configuration variables The Minimal Light theme will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`: ```yaml # Basic Information title: Your Name position: Ph.D. Student affiliation: Your Affiliation email: yourname (at) example.edu # Search Engine Optimization (SEO) # The following information is used to improve the website traffic from search engines, e.g., Google. keywords: minimal light description: The Minimal Light is a simple and elegant jekyll theme for academic personal homepage. canonical: # Links # If you don't need one of them, you may delete the corresponding line. google_scholar: cv_link: assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf github_link: linkedin: twitter: # Images (e.g., your profile picture and your website's favicon) # ""favicon"" and ""favicon_dark"" are used for the light and dark modes, respectively. avatar: ./assets/img/avatar.png favicon: ./assets/img/favicon.png favicon_dark: ./assets/img/favicon-dark.png # Footnote # You may use the option to disable the footnote, ""Powered by Jekyll and Minimal Light theme."" enable_footnote: true # Auto Dark Mode # You may use the option to disable the automatic dark theme auto_dark_mode: true # Font # You can use this option to choose between Serif or Sans Serif fonts. font: ""Serif"" # or ""Sans Serif"" # Google Analytics ID # Please remove this if you don't use Google Analytics google_analytics: UA-111540567-4 ``` ### Edit `index.md` Create `index.md` and add your personal information. It supports **Markdown** and **HTML** syntax. ### Edit included files There are two markdown files included in `index.md`. They are `_includes/publications.md` and `_includes/service.md`, respectively. These two files also support **Markdown** and **HTML** syntax. If you don't hope to include these two files, you may remove the following lines in `index.md`: If you hope to edit the publication list without changing the format, you may edit `_data/publications.yml`: ### Stylesheet If you'd like to add your own custom styles, you may edit `_sass/minimal-light.scss`. ### Layouts If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout, you may edit `_layout/homepage.html`. ## License This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal]( License. ## Acknowledgements Our project uses the source code from the following repositories: * [pages-themes/minimal]( * [orderedlist/minimal]( * [al-folio](","407, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, wontfix, question, invalid, help wanted, good first issue, enhancement, duplicate, documentation, bug"

spectrum-css,adobe/spectrum-css,1158,"['CSS', 'JavaScript', 'MDX']","['css', 'design-system']","Spectrum CSS A CSS-implementation of the Spectrum design language ## Features * **Robust documentation**: Spectrum CSS is designed to be used in partnership with [Spectrum's detailed usage guidelines]( * **Flexible**: Our CSS is customizable, powerful, and designed to work with any JavaScript framework. * **Rigorously tested**: These individually-versioned components have been vetted to be accessible and inclusive of global audiences. * **Multi-platform support**: We support [evergreen browsers]( for scalability and flexibility. []( []( ## Using Spectrum CSS The preferred method of using Spectrum CSS relies on custom properties to swap out variables for different themes and contexts. This results in the lowest bundle sizes and is one of the simpler approaches. Want to get a component up and running as soon as possible? Check out the [quick start guide]( ### Functionality Spectrum CSS is CSS-only, implementing only the interactivity that can be done with pure CSS. We do include some lightweight JS-based interaction for demonstration purposes only in our [Storybook]( Spectrum CSS should only be used by implementations of Spectrum, or very simple applications that only need things like typography, checkboxes, text fields, etc. Adobe maintains separate libraries written with [web components]( and [React]( that work in partnership with Spectrum CSS to create fully interactive Spectrum components. The [Spectrum Web Components]() library directly imports Spectrum CSS and optimizes it for use with web components. ### Installing components Each component is released on npm as a separate, individually versioned package inside of the [@spectrum-css]( org. To incorporate Spectrum CSS into your project, you install the components you need along with any peer dependencies you need for your implementation. Most peer dependencies are optional and can bring additional features when installed along with a component. For example a button can be rendered with or without an icon; so if your use-case leverages an icon with your button, you'll want to install icon as a peer dependency. ```shell yarn add -DW @spectrum-css/tokens @spectrum-css/typography @spectrum-css/page @spectrum-css/icon @spectrum-css/button ``` Installed components will be available in the `node_modules/@spectrum-css/` folder of your project. All components in this library have a peer dependency on [`@spectrum-css/tokens`](tokens), which is a local package that serves up the [Spectrum design tokens]( as CSS custom properties (via [Style dictionary]( These custom properties are leveraged in all components to create a cohesive visual language and to allow for easy theming. If you choose not to use the provided `@spectrum-css/tokens` package, you must define your own custom properties or your components will render with a significant number of missing styles. When overriding certain styles is necessary, modifying styles is supported through the use of component-specific `--mod` prefixed properties. [More on this below]( ### Using components in your project Spectrum CSS components have build output that is designed to be used in a variety of ways: * `index.css` - _Preferred and most commonly used to incorporate Spectrum CSS into a project_. This file includes the component's styles and variable definitions. In this version, token-driven CSS properties[1](#token-footnote) are mapped to empty `--mod` prefixed variables (for customization) with a fallback to variables prefixed with `--spectrum` (sourced from the design tokens). * This file loads both the `.spectrum` and `.spectrum--express` contexts which are used to toggle components between two different [visual styles]( The `.spectrum` context is the default. * `index-vars.css` - _Deprecated_. This file is identical to `index.css`. It is provided as a fallback for older implementations that may have been using it and will be removed. It is recommended to use `index.css` instead. * `index-base.css`: This file mimics the `index.css` output, but does not include the `.spectrum` or `.spectrum--express` contexts. * If your product only requires the `.spectrum` context, you can use `index-base.css` plus `themes/spectrum.css` from the `themes` directory to render the default Spectrum visual language. * The `.spectrum--express` context, on the other hand, is dependent on/expands on the default `.spectrum` context. This means if you only want to use the Express context, you still need to include `themes/spectrum.css`. In this case, we recommend using `index.css` instead since it includes both contexts by default. * This approach can also be used when you have defined and written your own visual language and only need the base component styles from Spectrum CSS. To wire up your own visual language, you would need to define your own custom properties that match those defined in the `themes/*.css` assets. * `index-theme.css`: This file provides only the visual language for a component. It is used in conjunction with `index-base.css` and when loaded together, provides the same result as using `index.css` by itself. 1: Token-driven CSS properties are properties whose values are mapped to a value in the `@spectrum-css/tokens` package. These values represent design-language and are meant to be used across platforms. In contrast, properties specific to web-based implementations will not have a token value assigned, so not all CSS properties will use custom properties. #### Including assets Start by including the base set of variables: ```css /* Include tokens */ @import ""node_modules/@spectrum-css/tokens/dist/index.css""; /* For components with no other contexts available, load the index.css file from the component's package. These are components that do not have a spectrum or express context available. */ @import ""node_modules/@spectrum-css/page/dist/index.css""; @import ""node_modules/@spectrum-css/typography/dist/index.css""; @import ""node_modules/@spectrum-css/icon/dist/index.css""; /* Recommended: For components with multiple contexts available, if you want access to all contexts, load the index.css file, which includes all contexts and component variables. */ @import ""node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/index.css""; /* If you only need the spectrum visual context: For components with multiple contexts available, load only the spectrum context by sourcing index-base.css and the spectrum theme from the themes directory. */ @import ""node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/index-base.css""; @import ""node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/themes/spectrum.css""; ``` Tokens values are mapped to context-specific classes which can be applied to the `` element or any place in your DOM where you wish to encapsulate or alter the visual language of your Spectrum components. All contexts you want to use must be defined in order to load all the appropriate custom properties for the components you are using. #### Global variables ##### Visual language * `.spectrum` - The default visual language for Spectrum CSS * `.spectrum--express` - A variant of the standard visual language. _This visual language will be deprecated in Spectrum 2_. ##### Scales Scales represent the browsing context of the user. They are used to adjust the size of components to improve readability and usability on different devices. * `.spectrum--medium` - The default scale for Spectrum CSS, used for desktop and tablet devices * `.spectrum--large` - A larger scale for Spectrum CSS, used for mobile devices and other small screens to create a more touch-friendly experience ##### Themes (colorstops) Themes represent the color scheme of the user's browsing context. They are used to adjust the color of components to improve readability and usability in different environments. * `.spectrum--light` - The default theme for Spectrum CSS, used for light mode * `.spectrum--dark` - A darker theme for Spectrum CSS, used for dark mode Other themes are available but are in the process of being deprecated and should not be used in new projects. #### Context example Put together, we would define the context for our application in the following way: ```html ``` To switch to Express, **add** the `.spectrum--express` class to the `` element: ```html ``` Note the `spectrum--express` class is added to the existing classes; `spectrum` should always be present to ensure the correct visual language is loaded. Because CSS custom properties honor the cascading nature of CSS, you can infinitely nest different contexts. For example, you could have a `.spectrum--dark` context inside of a `.spectrum--light` context, and components will honor the innermost context. ### Modifying components You can override variables and modify Spectrum CSS' look and feel by re-defining the custom properties in context. Look for the **Custom Property API** section in each component to determine which custom properties you can override. See [Action Button for a complete example]( ### Importing UI icons Some components require certain ""UI icons"" to render. These icons are released within the [`@spectrum-css/ui-icons`]( package and are used by components like `@spectrum-css/icon` and `@spectrum-css/actionbutton`. Based on [which scales]( you'll be using, you can choose to load different files: * `spectrum-css-icons.svg` - Both medium and large icons for responsive UIs that support both `.spectrum--medium` and `.spectrum--large` * `spectrum-css-icons-medium.svg` - Medium icons only, supports `.spectrum--medium` only * `spectrum-css-icons-large.svg` - Large icons only, supports `.spectrum--large` only **Note:** If you're using `spectrum-css-icons.svg`, be sure to add `.spectrum--medium` or `.spectrum--large` to the `` element, or you'll see both medium and large icons at once. ### Importing workflow icons If your app has any level of complexity, you'll need ""workflow"" icons to indicate actions. These icons are not required to render the base components, and instead are used within buttons or menu items for actions like share, play, ju...

obsidian-modular-css-layout,efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout,799,['CSS'],"['css', 'markdown']","# Modular CSS Layout for Obsidian This is a repository for modular CSS layout hack for use with [Obsidian.md]( It's meant to complement/assist Community Theme, focusing solely on providing alternative layout to standard width and standard top-bottom block view. I mainly do casual test on select popular themes like ITS, Primary, Shimmering Focus, Prism, and Minimal. Need your help to let me know if there's anything not working right. Do log in [MCL GH Issue]( if you find anything not working properly. ### Table of Content - [Install/Download](#installation--download-and-enable) - [Wide Views](#wide-views) - [Multi Column](#multi-column) - [Gallery Cards](#gallery-cards) - [Support Me](#support-me) ## Installation / Download and Enable This is actually just a CSS code snippets collection. So it isn't an installation per se, but rather download and enable in Obsidian. The best way is to use Mara Li's [Snippet Downloader]( plugin as I have plans to update this snippets from time to time ## Wide Views > CSS snippet: `MCL Wide Views.css` > This section only briefly explains Wide Views snippet. Please go through the documentation site [Wide Views - Modular CSS Layout]( for more details. This snippet provides you the following features: - Full width page or blocks (dataview, table and backlinks) per page/note basis by specifying custom `cssClass` at the frontmatter (YAML) - `wide-page` - `wide-dataview` - `wide-table` - `wide-callout` - `wide-backlinks` - vault-wide toggle for each of the above - Narrow width page per page/note basis for vault with RLL disabled by specifying custom `cssClass` at the frontmatter (YAML) - `narrow-page` - Adjustable RLL (custom css class toggle) applicable to entire vault - Disabled by default. Enable it via Style Settings plugin > [!TIP] > Thanks to Obsidian updated Electron base to V21, I have managed to avoid using Contextual Typography plugin to support wide blocks with the release of [v0.9.6]( #### Example ```markdown --- cssClass: wide-page --- ``` ## Multi Column > CSS snippet: `MCL Multi Column.css` > > This section only briefly explains Multi Column snippet. Please go through the documentation site [Multi Column - Modular CSS Layout]( for more details. This snippet provides you the following features: - Multi Column layout using Callout i.e. `> [!multi-column]` - List Column/Grid/Card layout using (Unordered) list by either (a) using tag, (b) using Markdown Attributes plugin, or (c) specifying in the frontmatter (YAML) - Float (Aside) Callout using callout metadata e.g. `> [!info|right-medium]` ### Multi Column Callout Multi Column Callout layout take advantage of Obsidian Callout - leveraging it as parent div to house the sub callout (including Dataview results block). You can nest as many sub-callouts within it. The sub-callout will expand if [!multi-column] callout has extra space or overflow to next row if it doesnt. #### Example of Multi Column Callout > *Example below is for the three callouts side-by-side in the picture above* > [!multi-column] > >> [!note]+ Use Case >> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. >> ##### User Case Background >> Vitae nunc sed velit dignissim sodales. In cursus turpis massa tincidunt dui ut ornare lectus. > >> [!warning]+ Resources >> #### Requirement >> - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet >> - Vitae nunc sed velit dignissim sodales. >> - In cursus turpis massa tincidunt dui ut ornare lectus. > >> [!todo]+ >> - [x] Define Use Case >> - [ ] Craft User Story >> - [ ] Develop draft sketches > note that when you insert callout within callout, the line separating the callouts should only use single angle bracket ("">"") ### List Column/Grid/Card This layout take advantage of markdown unordered list (i.e. `- list item`) to create multi column (and multi row for List Grid/Card) layout by matching with an identifier i.e. either `#mcl` tag, Markdown Attributes plugin syntax, or `cssclass:` key at frontmatter. Here are quick reference on the syntax for List Column/Grid/Card | Type | Using Tag | MD Attr plugin | Frontmatter | |---|---|---|---| | LCol |`#mcl/list-column`|`two-column-list-block` `three-column-list-block` `four-column-list-block` `multi-column-list-block`|`two-column-list` `three-column-list` `four-column-list` `multi-column-list`| | LGrd |`#mcl/list-grid` `#mcl/list-grid-wide`|-|`two-column-grid-list` `three-column-grid-list`| | LCrd |`#mcl/list-card` `#mcl/list-card-wide`|-|-| > Note: LCol = List Column // LGrd = List Grid // LCrd = List Card #### Example of List Grid *Example below is for the ""Goals and Objectives"" in the picture above* ```markdown ## List Grid Example - Goals and Objectives - #### Core Work #mcl/list-grid - [[00 Home|Main Goal 1]] - [[00 Home|Main Goal 2]] - [[00 Home|Main Goal 3]] - Collaboration with Jane - [[00 Home|Main Goal 4]] - #### Learning & System - [[00 Home|Learning Goal 1]] - [[00 Home|Initiative 1]] - [[00 Home|Initiative 2]] - #### Personal - [[00 Home|Personal Goal 1]] - [[00 Home|Personal Goal 2]] ``` ### Float Callout Float Callout will allow you to position side note or info box either to the left or right of the main note with other content wrapping around it. It uses callout-metadata to specify which side to float to and the size of the callout You can apply to any callout as the identifier is done on the callout-metadata i.e. after the `|` in `[!|]`. Table below gives some understanding of the syntax structure. |Apply in LP? | Which Side? | Preset FC Size | Example | |---|---|---|---| |`` `float`|`left``right`|`small` `medium` `large`| `[!info\|float-right-medium]` `[!blank\|right-small]`| ## Gallery Cards > CSS snippet: `MCL Gallery Cards.css` > > This section only briefly explains Gallery Cards snippet. Please go through the documentation site [Gallery Cards - Modular CSS Layout]( for more details. This snippet provides you the following features: - Image gallery using callout by specifying the callout-metadata `gallery` e.g. `> [!NOTE|gallery]` - Image gallery using YAML/frontmatter .`cssClass: image-gallery` - Float Image using image alt-text - Image and Mermaid Diagram Controls - Dimension control for images in bullet list - Image Zoom - Mermaid Scale and Zoom ### Float Image Float Image is similar to Float Callout but apply directly to the images (doesnt require you to wrap it in a callout). Currently it uses image caption to identify how you want to float it, but in the future I intend to make it work with anchor tag `#` as well. You can apply to any image as the identifier is done on the alt-text i.e. after the `|` in `[[path/to/image.jpg|alt-text]]` or the text inside `[]` in `[alt-text](path/to/image.jpg)`. Table below gives some understanding of the syntax structure. |Apply in LP? | Which Side? | Preset FC Size | Example | |---|---|---|---| |`` `float`|`left``right`|`small` `medium` `large`| `[[image.jpg\|float-right-medium]]` `[right-small](image.jpg)`| ## Support Me I do this on my free time for personal joy.

nowinandroid,android/nowinandroid,15571,"['Kotlin', 'Shell']","['android', 'jetpack-compose', 'kotlin']","Now in Android App ================== **Learn how this app was designed and built in the [design case study]( [architecture learning journey](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md) and [modularization learning journey](docs/ModularizationLearningJourney.md).** This is the repository for the [Now in Android]( app. It is a **work in progress** . **Now in Android** is a fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It follows Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a useful reference for developers. As a running app, it's intended to help developers keep up-to-date with the world of Android development by providing regular news updates. The app is currently in development. The `prodRelease` variant is [available on the Play Store]( # Features **Now in Android** displays content from the [Now in Android]( series. Users can browse for links to recent videos, articles and other content. Users can also follow topics they are interested in, and be notified when new content is published which matches interests they are following. ## Screenshots # Development Environment **Now in Android** uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into Android Studio (make sure you are using the latest stable version available [here]( Change the run configuration to `app`. The `demoDebug` and `demoRelease` build variants can be built and run (the `prod` variants use a backend server which is not currently publicly available). Once you're up and running, you can refer to the learning journeys below to get a better understanding of which libraries and tools are being used, the reasoning behind the approaches to UI, testing, architecture and more, and how all of these different pieces of the project fit together to create a complete app. # Architecture The **Now in Android** app follows the [official architecture guidance]( and is described in detail in the [architecture learning journey](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md). # Modularization The **Now in Android** app has been fully modularized and you can find the detailed guidance and description of the modularization strategy used in [modularization learning journey](docs/ModularizationLearningJourney.md). # Build The app contains the usual `debug` and `release` build variants. In addition, the `benchmark` variant of `app` is used to test startup performance and generate a baseline profile (see below for more information). `app-nia-catalog` is a standalone app that displays the list of components that are stylized for **Now in Android**. The app also uses [product flavors]( to control where content for the app should be loaded from. The `demo` flavor uses static local data to allow immediate building and exploring of the UI. The `prod` flavor makes real network calls to a backend server, providing up-to-date content. At this time, there is not a public backend available. For normal development use the `demoDebug` variant. For UI performance testing use the `demoRelease` variant. # Testing To facilitate testing of components, **Now in Android** uses dependency injection with [Hilt]( Most data layer components are defined as interfaces. Then, concrete implementations (with various dependencies) are bound to provide those interfaces to other components in the app. In tests, **Now in Android** notably does _not_ use any mocking libraries. Instead, the production implementations can be replaced with test doubles using Hilt's testing APIs (or via manual constructor injection for `ViewModel` tests). These test doubles implement the same interface as the production implementations and generally provide a simplified (but still realistic) implementation with additional testing hooks. This results in less brittle tests that may exercise more production code, instead of just verifying specific calls against mocks. Examples: - In instrumentation tests, a temporary folder is used to store the user's preferences, which is wiped after each test. This allows using the real `DataStore` and exercising all related code, instead of mocking the flow of data updates. - There are `Test` implementations of each repository, which implement the normal, full repository interface and also provide test-only hooks. `ViewModel` tests use these `Test` repositories, and thus can use the test-only hooks to manipulate the state of the `Test` repository and verify the resulting behavior, instead of checking that specific repository methods were called. To run the tests execute the following gradle tasks: - `testDemoDebug` run all local tests against the `demoDebug` variant. - `connectedDemoDebugAndroidTest` run all instrumented tests against the `demoDebug` variant. **Note:** You should not run `./gradlew test` or `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` as this will execute tests against _all_ build variants which is both unecessary and will result in failures as only the `demoDebug` variant is supported. No other variants have any tests (although this might change in future). ## Screenshot tests A screenshot test takes a screenshot of a screen or a UI component within the app, and compares it with a previously recorded screenshot which is known to be rendered correctly. For example, Now in Android has [screenshot tests]( to verify that the navigation is displayed correctly on different screen sizes ([known correct screenshots]( Now In Android uses [Roborazzi]( to run screenshot tests of certain screens and UI components. When working with screenshot tests the following gradle tasks are useful: - `verifyRoborazziDemoDebug` run all screenshot tests, verifying the screenshots against the known correct screenshots. - `recordRoborazziDemoDebug` record new ""known correct"" screenshots. Use this command when you have made changes to the UI and manually verified that they are rendered correctly. Screenshots will be stored in `modulename/src/test/screenshots`. - `compareRoborazziDemoDebug` create comparison images between failed tests and the known correct images. These can also be found in `modulename/src/test/screenshots`. **Note:** The known correct screenshots stored in this repository are recorded on CI using Linux. Other platforms may (and probably will) generate slightly different images, making the screenshot tests fail. When working on a non-Linux platform, a workaround to this is to run `recordRoborazziDemoDebug` on the `main` branch before starting work. After making changes, `verifyRoborazziDemoDebug` will identify only legitimate changes. For more information about screenshot testing [check out this talk]( # UI The app was designed using [Material 3 guidelines]( Learn more about the design process and obtain the design files in the [Now in Android Material 3 Case Study]( (design assets [also available as a PDF](docs/Now-In-Android-Design-File.pdf)). The Screens and UI elements are built entirely using [Jetpack Compose]( The app has two themes: - Dynamic color - uses colors based on the [user's current color theme]( (if supported) - Default theme - uses predefined colors when dynamic color is not supported Each theme also supports dark mode. The app uses adaptive layouts to [support different screen sizes]( Find out more about the [UI architecture here](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md#ui-layer). # Performance ## Benchmarks Find all tests written using [`Macrobenchmark`]( in the `benchmarks` module. This module also contains the test to generate the Baseline profile. ## Baseline profiles The baseline profile for this app is located at [`app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`](app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt). It contains rules that enable AOT compilation of the critical user path taken during app launch. For more information on baseline profiles, read [this document]( > [!NOTE] > The baseline profile needs to be re-generated for release builds that touch code which changes app startup. To generate the baseline profile, select the `benchmark` build variant and run the `BaselineProfileGenerator` benchmark test on an AOSP Android Emulator. Then copy the resulting baseline profile from the emulator to [`app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`](app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt). ## Compose compiler metrics Run the following command to get and analyse compose compiler metrics: ```bash ./gradlew assembleRelease -PenableComposeCompilerMetrics=true -PenableComposeCompilerReports=true ``` The reports files will be added to [build/compose-reports](build/compose-reports). The metrics files will also be added to [build/compose-metrics](build/compose-metrics).

Unciv,yairm210/Unciv,7820,"['Kotlin', 'Dockerfile', 'Shell']","['civilization-v', 'android', 'libgdx', 'civilization', 'game']","# Unciv - Civ V remake for Android & Desktop []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( ## What is this? An open source, moddability-focused Android and Desktop remake of Civ V, made with LibGDX ## Is this any good? Depends what you're looking for. If you're in the market for high-res graphics, amazing soundtracks, animations etc, I highly recommend Firaxis's Civ-V-like game, ""Civilization V"". If you want a small, fast, moddable, FOSS, in-depth 4X that can still run on a potato, you've come to the right place :) ## What's the roadmap? In this order: * Polish! As you may have noticed, Unciv is fully functional but rough around the edges. This means: * UI+UX improvements ([suggestions welcome!]( * Better automation, AI etc. in-game * G&K mechanics - espionage, small other changes (see [#4697]( * BNW mechanics - trade routes, world congress, etc. ## Contributing Programmers start [here]( Translators start [here]( Modders start [here]( You can join us in any of the open issue, or work on improving anything you want - once you're finished, issue a pull request and it'll go into the next version! If not, you can help by spreading the word - vote for Unciv where you can, mention it on Reddit or Twitter etc, and help us with new ideas of how to get the word out! ## FAQ ## How do I install? - **Android** - [Google Play]( or [F-droid]( - **Windows/Linux** - [itch.io]( Flatpak via [Flathub]( or [AUR]( - **Raspberry Pi** - [Pi-apps]( - **MacOS** - Install [with this guide]( - Jars, APKs and Windows/Linux builds also available in [Releases]( (run jar with `java -jar Unciv.jar`) - *not recommended* since we update frequently and you will quickly become out-of-date - [Build from scratch]( if that's your thing ### How about IOS? I'm not planning on it. It means paying money to Apple, yet another release path, and since I don't have an IOS device it means I can't test it properly. ### Steam release? Steam has decided that they don't want to host Unciv, they probably don't want to risk legal issues with Firaxis (although those should be non-existent, see below) ### Will you implement {feature}? If it's in the original Civ V, then yes! If not, then the feature won't be added to the base game - possibly it will be added as a way to mod the game, which is constantly expanding #### Why not? This is its own game, why not add features that weren't in Civ V? Having a clear vision is important for actually getting things done. Anyone can make a suggestion. Not all are good, viable, or simple. Not many can actually implement stuff. As an open source project, this stuff is done in our spare time, of which there isn't much. We need a clear-cut criteria to decide what to work on and what not to work on. #### Will you implement Civ VI? Considering how long it took to get this far, no. ### How can I learn to play? Where's the wiki? All the tutorial information is available in-game at menu > civilopedia > tutorials All the information is included in the amazing [Civ V wiki]( Since this is a Civ V clone, you can search Google for how to play Civ V and there are loads of answers =) Alternatively, you could [join us on Discord]( and ask there =D ### Aren't you basically making a Civ V clone? Is that even legal? According to the [US Copyright Office FL-108]( intellectual property rights *do not* apply to mechanics - as I'm sure you know, there are a billion Flappy Bird knockoffs It is definitely illegal: - To use any assets from the original game (images, sound etc) - they belong to Firaxis It is probably illegal (no solid sources on this): - To use the Civilization name - To impersonate the Civ games (so calling yourself civi|zation with a similar logo, for instance) Interestingly, [Civilization is a registered trademark]( but it looks like it's only *that particular logo* which is trademarked, so technically you could make another game called ""Civilization"" and it'll stick. In any case we're not going there :) ## Run with Docker []( If you have docker compose installed: ```$ docker compose build && docker compose up``` and then goto If just docker: ```$ docker build . -t unciv && docker run -d -p 6901:6901 -p 5901:5901 unciv ``` Or just use our already built one: ```$ docker run -d -p 6901:6901 -p 5901:5901 ghcr.io/yairm210/unciv ``` and then goto ## [Credits and 3rd parties](docs/Credits.md)","1.5k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Security, Insights, bug, feature, Will not stale, AI, help wanted, Stale, Conflicts, enhancement, UI, Missing saved game, wontfix, Documentation, performance, not enough translations, mergeable translation, Toolchain, Solved, Contains Saved Game"

chatgpt-android,skydoves/chatgpt-android,3561,['Kotlin'],"['android', 'chat', 'chatgpt', 'compose', 'jetpack']","**ChatGPT Android** demonstrates [OpenAI's ChatGPT]( on Android with [Stream Chat SDK for Compose]( The primary objective of this repository is to showcase the following: - Demonstrating [OpenAI's chat APIs]( - Creating comprehensive UI elements utilizing Jetpack Compose. - Incorporating Android architecture components using Jetpack libraries such as Hilt and AppStartup. - Executing background tasks efficiently through Kotlin Coroutines and WorkManager. - Seamlessly integrating chat systems via the [Stream Chat SDK for Compose]( to facilitate real-time event handling. ## Previews ## Stream Chat & Video SDKs **ChatGPT Android** is built with __[Stream Chat SDK for Compose]( to implement messaging systems. If youre interested in adding powerful In-App Messaging or real-time Video Chat to your app, check out the __[Android Chat Messaging Tutorial]( or __[Android Video Call Tutorial]( ! - [Stream Chat SDK for Android on GitHub]( - [Android Samples for Stream Chat SDK on GitHub]( - [Stream Chat Compose UI Componenets Guidelines]( If you're interested in building a real-time meeting room with video/audio calling, audio room, or livestreaming, check out the references below: - [Stream Video SDK for Android on GitHub]( - [Video Call Tutorial]( / [Audio Room Tutorial]( / [Livestream Tutorial]( ## How to build the project? For proper project setup, it's essential to follow the instructions below. In most cases, you can complete all configuration steps within 10 to 20 minutes: 1. Go to the __[Stream login page]( 2. If you have your GitHub or Google account, click the **Continue with GitHub** or **Continue with Google** button and you can sign up within a couple of seconds. 3. Go to the __[Dashboard]( and click the **Create App** button like the below. 4. Fill in the blanks like the below and click the **Create App** button. 5. You will see the **Key** like the figure below and then copy it. 6. Create a new file named **secrets.properties** on the root directory of this Android project, and add the key to the `secrets.properties` file like the below: ```gradle STREAM_API_KEY=.. ``` 7. Go to your __[Dashboard]( again and click your App. 9. In the **Overview** menu, you can find the **Authentication** category by scrolling to the middle of the page. 10. Switch on the **Disable Auth Checks** option and click the **Submit** button like the figure below. 11. Click the **Explorer** tab on the left side menu. 12. Click **users** -> **Create New User** button sequentially and add fill in the user like the below: - User Name: `Chat GPT` - User ID: `70ef052a-da88-4451-af92-99f7ed335a71` 13. Now, it's time to set up the OpenAI API key. Go to __[OpenAI API Dashboard]( login with your Google account and click **Start verification** to verify your phone number to create an API key. 14. After verifying your phone number, click the **Create new secret key** on the page like the image below and create your API key: 15. Copy and paste your API key to the `secrets.properties` file as named `GPT_API_KEY` under the `STREAM_API_KEY` field: ```gradle GPT_API_KEY=.. ``` 16. Unlock Rate limits for OpenAI APIs As per the guidelines outlined in their [Rate limits]( documentation, access to the free tier of the API is __granted after a minimum expenditure of $5 since the creation of your account__. That means, you should register your payment method to the OpenAI and purchase initial credits. So you should go to the [OpenAI Billings]( and click the **Add payment details** button like the image below: 17. Once you've added your payment deatils, you'll able to see the **Add to creadit balance** button like the image below: Next, click the **Add to credit balance** button to purchase the initial credit. As you've discovered in the previous step, the minimum credit starts from $5. Therefore, if you only intend to utilize the API limits for testing or building a side project, you can opt for the minimum pricing. Also, not that it's advisable to disable the automatic recharge option to avoid unexpected charges. 18. Once you've completed all those steps above, now build, run and enjoy your the project! ## Troubleshooting You can typically find the reasons behind your error code by referring to the [OpenAI Error code documentation]( ### 401 Error If you encounter 401 errors while chatting with ChatGPT app, as shown in the image below, it's crucial to verify the correctness of your OpenAI API key. Ensure that there are no typos in your API key and that it has been correctly copied and pasted into the `secrets.properties` file, as outlined in the guidelines above. ### 429 Error If you encounter this error from the outset, it's likely that your rate limits do not meet the requirements. Please revisit step 16 in the guidelines above for further instructions. ## Tech Stack & Open Source Libraries - Minimum SDK level 21. - 100% [Jetpack Compose]( based + [Coroutines]( + [Flow]( for asynchronous and cold streams. - [Compose Chat SDK for Messaging]( The Jetpack Compose Chat Messaging SDK is built on a low-level chat client and provides modular, customizable Compose UI components that you can easily drop into your app. - [OpenAI Chat API]( Given a list of messages comprising a conversation, the model will return a response. - Jetpack - Compose: Androids modern toolkit for building native UI. - ViewModel: UI related data holder and lifecycle aware. - App Startup: Provides a straightforward, performant way to initialize components at application startup. - Navigation: For navigating screens and [Hilt Navigation Compose]( for injecting dependencies. - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access. - [Hilt]( Dependency Injection. - [WorkManager]( To achieve background processing with scheduling. - [Landscapist Glide]( [animation]( [placeholder]( Jetpack Compose image loading library that fetches and displays network images with Glide, Coil, and Fresco. - [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3]( Construct the REST APIs and paging network data. - [Sandwich]( Construct a lightweight and modern response interface to handle network payload for Android. - [Moshi]( A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java. - [ksp]( Kotlin Symbol Processing API. - [Balloon]( Modernized and sophisticated tooltips, fully customizable with an arrow and animations for Android. - [viewmodel-lifecycle]( ViewModel Lifecycle allows you to track and observe Jetpack's ViewModel lifecycle changes. - [StreamLog]( A lightweight and extensible logger library for Kotlin and Android. - [Baseline Profiles]( To improve app performance by including a list of classes and methods specifications in your APK that can be used by Android Runtime. ## Architecture **ChatGPT Android** follows the [Google's official architecture guidance]( **ChatGPT Android** was built with [Guide to app architecture]( so it would be a great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects. The overall architecture is composed of two layers; UI Layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they each have different responsibilities. The arrow means the component has a dependency on the target component following its direction. ### Architecture Overview Each layer has different responsibilities below. Basically, they follow [unidirectional event/data flow]( ### UI Layer The UI Layer consists of UI elements like buttons, menus, tabs that could interact with users and [ViewModel]( that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes. ### Data Layer The data Layer consists of repositories, which include business logic, such as querying data from the local database and requesting remote data from the network. It is implemented as an offline-first source of business logic and follows the [single source of truth]( principle. For more information about the overall architecture, check out **[Build a Real-Time WhatsApp Clone With Jetpack Compose]( ## Modularization **ChatGPT Android** adopted modularization strategies below: - **Reusability**: Modulizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time. - **Parallel Building**: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time. - **Decentralized focusing**: Each developer team can assign their dedicated module and they can focus on their own modules. ## MAD Score ## Contribution Most of the features are not completed except the chat feature, so anyone can contribute and improve this project following the [Contributing Guideline]( ## Find this repository useful?

rethink-app,celzero/rethink-app,2483,"['Kotlin', 'Java']","['android-app', 'firewall', 'android-firewall', 'dns-over-https', 'internet-freedom']","## Rethink DNS + Firewall + VPN for Android A [WireGuard]( client, an [OpenSnitch]( firewall and network monitor + a [pi-hole]( DNS over HTTPS client with blocklists. []( []( In other words, Rethink DNS + Firewall has three primary modes, VPN, DNS, and Firewall. The VPN (proxifier) mode supports multiple WireGuard upstreams in a split-tunnel configuration. The DNS mode routes all DNS traffic generated by apps to _any_ user chosen DNS-over-HTTPS or DNSCrypt resolver. The Firewall mode lets the user deny internet-access to entire applications based on events like screen-on / screen-off, app-foreground / app-background, unmetered-connection / metered-connection; or based on play-store defined categories like Social, Games, Utility, Productivity; or additionally, based on user-defined denylists. ### VPN / Proxifier Rethink supports forwarding TCP and UDP connections over SOCKS5, HTTP CONNECT, and WireGuard tunnels. Split-tunneling further helps run multiple such tunnels at the same time and lets users route different apps over different tunnels. For example, one could route Firefox over SOCKS5 connecting to Tor, Netflix over WireGuard connecting through any popular VPN provider, and Telegram or WhatsApp over censorship-resistant HTTP CONNECT endpoints at the same time. ### Firewall The firewall doesn't really care about the connections per se rather what's making those connections. This is different from the traditional firewalls but in-line with [Little Snitch]( [LuLu]( [Glasswire]( and others. Currently, per-app connection mapping is implemented by capturing `udp` and `tcp` connections managed by [`firestack`]( (written in golang) and asking [ConnectivityService for the owner]( an API available only on Android 10 or higher. `procfs` (`/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/udp`) is read on-demand to track per-app connections like [NetGuard]( or OpenSnitch do, on Android 9 and lower versions. ### Network Monitor A network monitor is a per-app report-card of sorts on when connections were made, how many were made, and to where. Tracking TCP has turned out to be so far straight-forward. DNS packets are trickier to track, and so a rough heuristic is used for now, which may not hold good in all cases. ### DNS over HTTPS client Almost all of the network related code (`firestack`), including DNS over HTTPS split-tunnel, is a hard fork of [Jigsaw-Code/outline-go-tun2socks]( written in golang. The UI is vastly different but borrows minimally from [Jigsaw-Code/Intra]( A split-tunnel traps requests sent to the VPN's DNS endpoint and relays it to a DNS-over-HTTPS / DNSCrypt endpoint of the user's choosing, logging the end-to-end latency, time of request, the dns request query itself and its answer. ### The Rethink DNS Resolver A malware and ad-blocking DNS over HTTPS resolver at ` (deployed to 300+ locations world-wide via Cloudflare Workers) is the default DNS endpoint on the app, though the user is free to change that. A configurable DNS resolver that lets users add or remove denylists and allowlists, add rewrites, analyse DNS requests is launching late 2023. Right now, a free-to-use DNS over HTTPS endpoint with custom blocklists can be setup here: [rethinkdns.com/configure]( The resolver is deployed to [Fly.io]( at `max.rethinkdns.com` and [Deno Deploy]( at `rdns.deno.dev` too, apart from the default deployment on [Cloudflare Workers]( The resolver is open source software: [serverless-dns]( ### The Rethink Proxy Network Routing TCP connections over a serverless proxy (hosted on Cloudflare Workers) [will soon be part of Rethink]( Users would be able to self-host these or use the ones run by us for $1 month of unlimited bandwidth. This service is expected to be launching late 2023. The proxy is open source software: [serverless-proxy]( ### Community []( - The telegram community is super active and full of crypto-bros. Kidding. We are generally a welcoming bunch. Feel free to get in touch: [t.me/rethinkdns]( - Or, if you prefer [Matrix]( (which is bridged to Telegram). - Or, email us: [hello@celzero.com](mailto:hello@celzero.com) (we read all emails immediately and reply once we fix the issues being reported). - We regularly hangout in our subreddit: [r/rethinkdns]( - We're also kind of active on the bird app, mostly nerd-sniping other engs or shit-posting about our tech stack: [twitter/rethinkdns]( ### Translation Help translate Rethink DNS + Firewall on [Weblate]( []( ### What Rethink DNS + Firewall is not Rethink is not an anonymity tool: It helps users tackle unabated censorship and surveillance but doesn't lay claim to protecting a user's identity at all times, if ever. Rethink doesn't aim to be a feature-rich traditional firewall: It is more in-line with [Little Snitch]( than IP tables, say. Rethink is not an anti-virus: Rethink may stop users from phishing attacks, malware, scareware websites through its DNS-based blocklists, but it doesn't actively mitigate threats or even look for them or act on them, otherwise. ### What Rethink DNS + Firewall aspires to be To turn Android devices into user-agents: Something that users can control as they please without requiring root-access. A big part of this, for an always-on, always-connected devices, is capturing network traffic and reporting it in a way that makes sense to the end-users who can then take a series of actions to limit their exposure but not necessarily eliminate it. Take DNS for example-- for most if not all connections, apps send out a DNS request first, and by tracking just those one can glean a lot of intelligence about what's happening with the phone and which app's responsible. To deliver the promise of open-internet for all: With the inevitable ESNI standardization and the imminent adoption of DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS across operating systems, we're that much closer to an open internet. Of course, *Deep Packet Inspection* remains a credible threat that can't be mitigated with this, but it is one example of delivering maximum impact (circumvent internet censorship in most countries) with minimal effort (not requiring use of a VPN or access via IPFS, for example). Rethink would continue to make these technologies accessible in the most simplest way possible, especially the ones that get 90% of the way there with 10% effort. ## Development []( 1. Feel free to fork and send along a pull request for any reproducible bug fixes. 1. The codebase is raw and is lacking documentation and comprehensive tests. If you need help, feel free to create a Wikipage to highlight the pain with building, testing, writing, committing code. 2. Write descriptive commit messages that explain concisely the changes made. 3. Each commit must reference an open issue on the project. This is to make sure there isn't duplicated effort more than anything else. 2. If you plan to work on a feature, please create a github issue on the project first to kickstart the discussion before committing to doing any work. Again, this is to avoid duplicate work more than anything else. 3. Prod releases are usually once every 2 months, while betas are released bi-weekly. ## Tenets (unless you know better ones) We aren't there yet, may never will be but these are some tenets for the project for the foreseeable future. - Make it right, make it secure, make it resilient, make it fast. In that order. - Easy to use, no-root, no-gimmicks features that are anti-censorship and anti-surveillance. - Easy to use: Any of the 3B+ Android users must be able to use it. Think CleanMaster / Instagram levels of ease-of-use. - no-root: Shouldn't require root-access for any functionality added to it. - no-gimmicks: Misleading material bordering on scareware, for example. - anti-censorship: Features focused on helping bring an open internet to everyone, preferably in the most efficient way possible (both monetarily and technically). - Anti-surveillance: As above, but features that further limit (may not necessarily eliminate) surveillance by apps. - Incremental changes in balance with newer features. - For example, work on nagging UI issues or OEM specific bugs, must be taken up on equal weight to newer features, and a release must probably establish a good balance between the two. However; working on only incremental changes for a release is fine. - Opinionated. Chip-away complexity. Do not expect users to require a PhD in Computer Science to use the app. - No duplicate functionality. - A concerted effort to not provide too many tunable knobs and settings. To err on the side of easy over simple. - Ignore all tenets. - Common sense always takes over when tenets get in the way. - Must be distributable on the PlayStore, at least some toned down version of it. - This unfortunately means on-device blocklists aren't possible; however, [Cloudflare Gateway]( cloud-based per-user blocklists get us the same functionality. - Practice what you preach: Be obsessively private and secure. ## Backstory []( []( []( Internet censorship (sometimes ISP-enforced and often times government-enforced), unabated dragnet surveillance (by pretty much every company and app) stirred us upon this path. The three of us university classmates, [Mohammed]( [Murtaza]( [Santhosh]( got together in late 2019 in the sleepy town of Coimbatore, India to do something about it. Our main gripe was there were all these wonderful tools that people could use but couldn't, either due to cost or due to inability to grok Computer-specific jargon. A lot has happened since we started and a lot has changed but our focus has always been on Android and its 2B+ unsuspecting users. The current idea has been in the works for since May 2020, with the pandemic derailing a bit of progress, and a bit of snafu with abandoning our previous version in favour of the current fork, which we aren't proud of yet, but it is a start. All's good now that we've won a grant from the [Mozilla Builders MVP program]( to go ahead and build this thing that we wanted to... do so faster... and not simply ...

BCR,chenxiaolong/BCR,1432,"['Kotlin', 'Shell', 'Python']",[],"# Basic Call Recorder []( [](./LICENSE) BCR is a simple Android call recording app for rooted devices or devices running custom firmware. Once enabled, it stays out of the way and automatically records incoming and outgoing calls in the background. ## Features * Supports Android 9 and newer * Supports output in various formats: * OGG/Opus - Lossy, smallest files, default on Android 10+ * M4A/AAC - Lossy, smaller files, default on Android 9 * FLAC - Lossless, larger files * WAV/PCM - Lossless, largest files, least CPU usage * Supports Android's Storage Access Framework (can record to SD cards, USB devices, etc.) * Per-contact auto-record rules * Quick settings toggle * Material You dynamic theming * No persistent notification unless a recording is in progress * No network access permission * Works with call screening on Pixel devices (records the caller, but not the automated system) * Supports both Magisk and KernelSU ## Non-features As the name alludes, BCR intends to be a basic as possible. The project will have succeeded at its goal if the only updates it ever needs are for compatibility with new Android versions. Thus, many potentially useful features will never be implemented, such as: * Support for old Android versions (support is dropped as soon as maintenance becomes cumbersome) * Workarounds for [OEM-specific battery optimization and app killing behavior]( * Workarounds for devices that don't support the [`VOICE_CALL` audio source]( (eg. using microphone + speakerphone) * Support for direct boot mode (the state before the device is initially unlocked after reboot) * Support for stock, unrooted firmware ## Usage 1. Download the latest version from the [releases page]( To verify the digital signature, see the [verifying digital signatures](#verifying-digital-signatures) section. 2. Install BCR as a system app. * **For devices rooted with Magisk/KernelSU**, simply flash the zip as a Magisk/KernelSU module from within the respective application. * **For OnePlus and Realme devices running the stock firmware (or custom firmware based on the stock firmware)**, also extract the `.apk` from the zip and install it manually before rebooting. This is necessary to work around a bug in the firmware where the app data directory does not get created, causing BCR to open up to a blank screen. * **For unrooted custom firmware**, flash the zip while booted into recovery. * **NOTE**: The `READ_CALL_LOG` permission is hard restricted in Android 10+, which prevents it from being granted, even via Android's settings. To remove this restriction, run via adb: ```bash # If rooted, run inside of `su`: CLASSPATH=/system/priv-app/com.chiller3.bcr/app-release.apk app_process / com.chiller3.bcr.standalone.RemoveHardRestrictionsKt # If unrooted, install BCR as both a user app and a system app: pm install /system/priv-app/com.chiller3.bcr/app-release.apk ``` * **NOTE**: If the custom firmware's `system` partition is formatted with `erofs`, then the filesystem is read-only and it is not possible to use this method. * Manually extracting the files from the `system/` folder in the zip will also work as long as the files have `644` permissions and the `u:object_r:system_file:s0` SELinux label. 3. Reboot and open BCR. If other call recorders are installed, make sure to disable their phone call recording functionality. On most devices, a phone call cannot be recorded by two apps at the same time. However, it is fine to have BCR record phone calls and another app record eg. VOIP calls. 4. Enable call recording and pick an output directory. If no output directory is selected or if the output directory is no longer accessible, then recordings will be saved to `/sdcard/Android/data/com.chiller3.bcr/files`. Note that on Android 12+, `/sdcard/Android/data/` is only accessible via USB or DocumentsUI (AOSP's built in file manager). When enabling call recording the first time, BCR will prompt for microphone, notification (Android 13+), call log, contacts, and phone permissions. Only microphone and notification permissions are required for basic call recording functionality. If additional permissions are granted, more information is added to the output filename. For example, the contacts permission will allow the contact name to be added to the filename. See the [permissions section](#permissions) below for more details about the permissions. 5. To install future updates, there are a couple methods: * If installed via Magisk, the module can be updated right from Magisk Manager's modules tab. Flashing the new version in Magisk manually also works just as well. * The `.apk` can also be extracted from the zip and be directly installed. With this method, the old version exists as a system app and the new version exists as a user-installed update to the system app. This method is more convenient if BCR is baked into the Android firmware image. ## Permissions * `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` (**automatically granted by system app permissions**) * Needed to capture the call audio stream. * `CONTROL_INCALL_EXPERIENCE` (**automatically granted by system app permissions**) * Needed to monitor the phone call state for starting and stopping the recording and gathering call information for the output filename. * `RECORD_AUDIO` (**must be granted by the user**) * Needed to capture the call audio stream. * `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` (**automatically granted at install time**) * Needed to run the call recording service. * `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (**must be granted by the user on Android 13+**) * Needed to show notifications. * A notification is required for running the call recording service in foreground mode or else Android will not allow access to the call audio stream. * `READ_CALL_LOG` (**optional**) * If allowed, the name as shown in the call log can be added to the output filename. * This is also required to show the correct phone number when using call redirection apps. * `READ_CONTACTS` (**optional**) * If allowed, the contact name can be added to the output filename. It also allows auto-record rules to be set per contact. * `READ_PHONE_STATE` (**optional**) * If allowed, the SIM slot for devices with multiple active SIMs is added to the output filename. * `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` (**optional**) * If allowed, request Android to disable battery optimizations (app killing) for BCR. * This is usually not needed. The way BCR hooks into the telephony system makes it unlikely to be killed. * OEM Android builds that stray further from AOSP may ignore this. * `VIBRATE` (**automatically granted at install time**) * If vibration is enabled for BCR's notifications in Android's settings, BCR will perform the vibration. Android itself does not respect the vibration option when a phone call is active. Note that `INTERNET` is _not_ in the list. BCR does not and will never access the network. BCR will never communicate with other apps either, except if the user explicitly taps on the `Open` or `Share` buttons in the notification shown when a recording completes. In that scenario, the target app is granted access to that single recording only. ## Call redirection BCR has limited support for call redirection apps, like Google Voice. Redirected calls can be recorded only if the call redirection service uses standard telephone calls behind the scenes (instead of VOIP). There are several limitations when recording redirected calls compared to regular calls: * The call must not be a conference call. Otherwise, the filename will only show the call redirection service's proxy phone number. * Auto-record rules will not work properly. Redirected calls will never match any rules for specified contacts and will only match the `All other calls` rule. * During the call, BCR's notification will only show the call redirection service's proxy phone number. * BCR must be granted the call logs permission. * The dialer app must put the original phone number into the system call log. The AOSP and Google dialer apps do, but other OEM dialer apps might not. These limitations exist because when a call is redirected, only the dialer app itself is aware of the original phone number. The Android telephony system is not aware of it. BCR can only find the original phone number by searching the system call log when the dialer adds the entry at the end of the call. ## Filename template BCR supports customizing the template used for determining the output filenames of recordings. The default template is: ``` {date}[_{direction}|][_sim{sim_slot}|][_{phone_number}|][_[{contact_name}|{caller_name}|{call_log_name}]|] ``` ### Template syntax * Curly braces (`{var}`) are used to refer to variables. Variables are replaced by the value they represent. For example, `{phone_number}` is replaced by the actual phone number of the call. * Square brackets (`[{var}|default]`) are used for specifying fallbacks. For example, `[{contact_name}|{caller_name}|Unknown]` will insert the contact name if the number is in the contacts. Otherwise, it'll fall back to the caller ID or `Unknown` if neither the contact name nor caller ID exist. Falling back to an empty string is perfectly valid too. For example, `[{contact_name}|]` evaluates to either the contact name or nothing. ### Template variables * `{date}`: The timestamp of the call. The default timestamp format tries to be as unambiguous as possible and is in the form: `20230414_215701.088-0400`. A custom timestamp format can be specified with `{date:}`. For example, `{date:yyyy-MM-dd @ h.mm.ss a}` would produce `2023-04-14 @ 9.57.01 PM`. A full list of timestamp formatting characters can be found at: * For the file retention feature to work, the date must not immediately follow another variable. For example, `{phone_number}{date}` will cause file retention to be disabled, but `{phone_number} ({date})` works because there's some text ` (` between the two variables. * If the date format is changed, the old recordings should be manually renamed or...

Translations Differences to NewPipe With NewPipe, the extraction is done locally on your phone, and all the requests sent towards YouTube/Google are done directly from the network you're connected to, which doesn't use a middleman server in between. Therefore, Google can still access information such as the user's IP address. Aside from that, subscriptions can only be stored locally. LibreTube takes this one step further and proxies all requests via Piped (which uses the NewPipeExtractor). This prevents Google servers from accessing your IP address or any other personal data. Apart from that, Piped allows syncing your subscriptions between LibreTube and Piped, which can be used on desktop too. If the NewPipeExtractor breaks, it only requires an update of Piped and not LibreTube itself. Therefore, fixes usually arrive faster than in NewPipe. While LibreTube only supports YouTube, NewPipe also allows the use of other platforms like SoundCloud, PeerTube, Bandcamp and media.ccc.de. Both are great clients for watching YouTube videos.

Trail-Sense,kylecorry31/Trail-Sense,979,"['Kotlin', 'Python', 'HTML']","['android', 'barometer', 'altimeter', 'compass', 'gps']","# Trail Sense > Use your Android phone's sensors to assist with wilderness treks or survival situations. Designed for entirely offline use. []( []( []( Trail Sense is a tool, and just like any other tool that you bring into the wilderness, it's essential to have backup equipment and skills. As featured in the [#WeArePlay]( campaign! See the [Technical Blog / Research]( F-Droid Google Play ## Table of Contents - [Feature Roadmap](#feature-roadmap) - [Goals](#goals) - [Features](#features) - [Privacy](#privacy) - [Contributing](#contributing) - [FAQ](#faq) - [Support](#support) - [Open Source Credits](#open-source-credits) - [License](#license) ## Feature Roadmap (2024) The feature roadmap is a tentative outline of the major features that are planned to be completed in the next year. Smaller features may end up being implemented in between. - [x] Augmented reality - [ ] Automations - [ ] Path navigation - [ ] Experiment with the first plugin (Comms) ## Goals - Trail Sense must not use the Internet in any way, as I want the entire app usable when there is no Internet connection - Features must provide some benefits to people using the app while hiking, in a survival situation, etc. - Features should make use of the sensors on a phone rather than relying on stored information such as guides - Features must be based on peer-reviewed science or be verified against real world data - [Use Cases]( ## Features - Designed for hiking, backpacking, camping, and geocaching - Place beacons and navigate to them - Follow paths - Retrace your steps with backtrack - Use a photo as a map - Plan what to pack - Be alerted before the sun sets - Predict the weather - Use your phone as a flashlight - [And much more!]( See the need for a new feature? [Post it here!]( For a list of community contributed device feature support, [go here]( # Privacy Location information gathered by this application does not leave your device (as a matter of fact, this app doesn't use the Internet at all). The altitude and pressure history for the last 48 hours is stored in local app storage - this is used to determine weather forecasts. The last known location is also stored in app preferences to allow faster load times and support app functionality when the GPS can not be reached. The beacons and paths store their location information in a local SQLite database. All of this information is cleared when you clear the app storage or delete it. ## Permissions ### Sensitive - **POST_NOTIFICATIONS** - Allows Trail Sense to display notifications (backtrack, weather, sunset alerts, astronomy events, water boil timer, etc) - **When denied**: Alerts will not be displayed and some services may not function properly depending on your device manufacturer. - **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION / ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** - Allows Trail Sense to retrieve your location for navigation, weather (sea level calibration), and astronomy. - **When denied**: You will have the ability to mock your location under Settings > Sensors > GPS. On Android 14+, backtrack and weather will be unavailable due to Android OS constraints. - **ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION** - Allows Trail Sense to retrieve your location for sunset alerts while in the background. On some devices, this will also improve the reliability of backtrack and weather monitor (though shouldn't be needed on most devices). - **When denied**: If you travel and do not open Trail Sense, but have Sunset Alerts enabled, the times will likely be inaccurate. - **ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION** - Allows Trail Sense to use your phone's pedometer for distance calculation. - **When denied**: The pedometer will not work. - **CAMERA** - Allows Trail Sense to use your camera on the sighting compass, clinometer, and for taking photos used by the Cloud Scanner, QR Code Scanner, and Photo Maps. - **When denied**: You will not be able to use the sighting compass, camera clinometer, or QR Code Scanner. You will need to pick an existing photo to use for the Cloud Scanner or Photo Maps. - **SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM** - Allows Trail Sense to post a notification at an exact time. This is used by the Clock tool (when updating system time) and Sunset Alerts. - **When denied**: The clock and sunset alerts may not be accurate (can be off by several minutes). ### Not sensitive (always granted) - **RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED** - Allows Trail Sense to restart when you reboot your device. This will re-enable backtrack, weather monitor, and several other background services. - **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** - Allows Trail Sense to start foreground services, such as backtrack and weather monitor. - **FLASHLIGHT** - Allows Trail Sense to control the phone's flashlight. - **VIBRATE** - Allows Trail Sense to vibrate the phone. Used for haptic feedback on dials and on the metal detector tool. - **WAKE_LOCK** - Allows Trail Sense to reliably run services such as backtrack and weather monitor, especially when the frequency is under 15 minutes. # Debug features Only available on debug APKs / builds via Android Studio - Weather tool's barometer chart shows unsmoothed readings in background - Weather history, elevation history, path elevations, and latest cloud scan are logged to the files/debug folder in Trail Sense data as CSV files - Weather settings shows statistics timing (for weather monitor service) - Paths show statistics about timing (for backtrack service) # Contributing See the [CONTRIBUTING.md]( file for details on contributing to Trail Sense. # FAQ The FAQ has moved [to the wiki]( # Support The best way to support Trail Sense is to send me your feedback, share how you are using it, test nightly builds, or post your ideas for new features. # Open Source Credits - Thank you to everyone who tried out this app and opened issues, suggested features, provided translations, or tested debug builds for me - Please see the in app licenses for all open source licenses - Contributors and translators: - [showdownjs]( used for website markdown rendering [License]( # License []( - **[MIT license](LICENSE)**","66, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, p4, p3, help wanted, research, tool-paths, tool-photo-maps, tech-debt, tool-navigation, tool-weather, feature-request, tool-astronomy, tool-augmented-reality, settings, tool-tides, p2, sensor-gps, bug, tools, sensor-compass, tool-pedometer, tool-packing-lists, tool-battery, tool-beacons, sensor-altimeter, tool-flashlight, tool-convert, documentation, translations, tool-whistle, plugin"

It also packs a nice looking Terminal Emulator, Usage Stats, Split/APK Installer and various other tools and many of them are waiting to be implemented as well. On top of that, Inure's all functionalities been made to work with both Root and Shizuku modes. Inure's development was started as an independent learning project which later has become one of the most ambitious and intuitive Android apps developed by a single person and is based 100% on custom UI APIs developed to be used only in this app with its own native theme engine, crash handler, image renderer and a beautiful animation framework. Along with it own UI perks, Inure also supports dynamic Material You colors with dedicated accent and theme color modes. The app is in stable testing stage. You can join app's [Telegram Group]( and get development related updates. ### Features See the [concise list of features of the app here](./FEATURES.md). ## Screenshots ### App's Interface | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03 | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x04 | 0x05 | 0x06 | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x07 | 0x08 | 0x09 | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x00 | 0x0A | 0x0B | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x0C | 0x0D | 0x0E | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x0F | 0x11 | 0x12 | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x13 | 0x14 | 0x15 | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x16 | 0x17 | 0x18 | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x19 | 0x1A | 0x1B | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x1C | 0x1D | 0x1E | | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x1F | 0x20 | 0x21 | ### Accessibility Various accessibility features to make the app more accessible to users. Inure also supports an option to add more colors to interface of various types including Pastel, Coffee (soothing) and Retro (color blocked) for users who don't prefer monochromatic interface or have difficulty using it. Including that, Inure also supports highlighting clickable elements and divider for users who have difficulty in differentiating spaces between interface elements. Further more, it's also possible to disable all animations to reduce excessive motion in the app. Inure has options to adjust animation requirements over multiple levels from all animations to no animations with fine granularity. | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x00 | 0x01 | 0x02 | ### Menus and Dialogs Inure has 3 different styles of Menu and Dialogs type depending on how they're required, the popup type used for quick actions follows the user thumb on the screen, the modal dialog is used to adjust panel level preferences and chip style dialog for managing filter flags and tags. These three work together to refine a good level of UX and UI without overloading the user with a lot of options. | | | | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| | 0x00 | 0x01 | 0x02 | If you've any questions or suggestions for design, please initiate a discussion or an issue. ## Contribute #### Include your app in Inure's FOSS panel If you are a developer and want your app to be listed in the FOSS panel of Inure and show a FOSS indicator alongside your app, there are two ways this can be done. 1. You can publish your app on F-Droid. Inure automatically marks the app as FOSS if it's available on F-Droid. 2. You can add `open_source` and `open_source_license` tag in your app's manifest file and Inure will fetch this info during the runtime and will include your app based on the flag. ```xml ``` #### Participate in Community Permission Descriptions Community permissions descriptions of some OEM or Developer defined permissions for native framework or system apps whose details Android doesn't or cannot provide. You can read the complete [guidelines here]( on how to contribute. #### Developers Inure's repo doesn't require any special setup, clone/fork the repo and run in [Android Studio]( and let the initial setup finish automatically and you'll be good to go. #### Not a developer? You can take participation in app's translation on [Crowdin]( and watch Inure work in your language and make the app more user friendly to everyone speaking your tongue. Alternatively, you can also edit/upload your locale's strings from `app/src/main/res/values-locale-code` directory. #### Want to show you were here? You cannot do the above still wanna show your support? hit the star and let me know you were here and appreciate the project. ## License **Inure App Manager** Copyright 2023 - Hamza Rizwan **Inure App Manager** is released as open source software under the [GPL v3]( license, see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the project root for the full license text. ## Behind The Scenes | | |:------------------------------------------:| | Designing of interface skeletons for Inure | | | |:---------------------------------------------:| | Audio Player interface design (later removed) | | | |:---------------------------------------:| | Presentation design for Batch interface |","52, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Wiki, Security, Insights, feature request, enhancement, awaiting api support, bug, wontfix, wontadd, wip, question, out of scope, not planned, invalid, inactive, help wanted, good first issue, error, duplicate, documentation, cant reproduce, bad issue, Q/A"

KMP-NativeCoroutines,rickclephas/KMP-NativeCoroutines,976,"['Kotlin', 'Swift', 'Java']","['ios', 'kotlin', 'swift', 'kotlin-coroutines', 'kotlin-multiplatform']","# KMP-NativeCoroutines A library to use Kotlin Coroutines from Swift code in KMP apps. ## Why this library? Both KMP and Kotlin Coroutines are amazing, but together they have some limitations. The most important limitation is cancellation support. Kotlin suspend functions are exposed to Swift as functions with a completion handler. This allows you to easily use them from your Swift code, but it doesn't support cancellation. > [!NOTE] > While Swift 5.5 brings async functions to Swift, it doesn't solve this issue. > For interoperability with ObjC all functions with a completion handler can be called like an async function. > This means starting with Swift 5.5 your Kotlin suspend functions will look like Swift async functions. > But that's just syntactic sugar, so there's still no cancellation support. Besides cancellation support, ObjC doesn't support generics on protocols. So all the `Flow` interfaces lose their generic value type which make them hard to use. This library solves both of these limitations . ## Compatibility The latest version of the library uses Kotlin version `2.0.0`. Compatibility versions for older and/or preview Kotlin versions are also available: | Version | Version suffix | Kotlin | KSP | Coroutines | |----------------|-------------------|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:| | **_latest_** | **_no suffix_** | **2.0.0** | **1.0.21** | **1.8.1** | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-30 | _no suffix_ | 1.9.24 | 1.0.20 | 1.8.1 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-28 | _no suffix_ | 1.9.23 | 1.0.20 | 1.8.0 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-25 | _no suffix_ | 1.9.22 | 1.0.17 | 1.8.0 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-23 | _no suffix_ | 1.9.21 | 1.0.16 | 1.7.3 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-21 | _no suffix_ | 1.9.20 | 1.0.14 | 1.7.3 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-18 | _no suffix_ | 1.9.10 | 1.0.13 | 1.7.3 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-17 | _no suffix_ | 1.9.0 | 1.0.12 | 1.7.3 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-12 | _no suffix_ | 1.8.22 | 1.0.11 | 1.7.2 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-10 | _no suffix_ | 1.8.21 | 1.0.11 | 1.7.1 | | 1.0.0-ALPHA-7 | _no suffix_ | 1.8.20 | 1.0.10 | 1.6.4 | You can choose from a couple of Swift implementations. Depending on the implementation you can support as low as iOS 9, macOS 10.9, tvOS 9 and watchOS 3: | Implementation | Swift | iOS | macOS | tvOS | watchOS | |----------------|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-------:| | Async | 5.5 | 13.0 | 10.15 | 13.0 | 6.0 | | Combine | 5.0 | 13.0 | 10.15 | 13.0 | 6.0 | | RxSwift | 5.0 | 9.0 | 10.9 | 9.0 | 3.0 | ## Installation The library consists of a Kotlin and Swift part which you'll need to add to your project. The Kotlin part is available on Maven Central and the Swift part can be installed via CocoaPods or the Swift Package Manager. Make sure to always use the same versions for all the libraries! ### Kotlin For Kotlin just add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`: ```kotlin plugins { id(""com.google.devtools.ksp"") version ""2.0.0-1.0.21"" id(""com.rickclephas.kmp.nativecoroutines"") version ""1.0.0-ALPHA-31"" } ``` and make sure to opt in to the experimental `@ObjCName` annotation: ```kotlin kotlin.sourceSets.all { languageSettings.optIn(""kotlin.experimental.ExperimentalObjCName"") } ``` ### Swift (Swift Package Manager) The Swift implementations are available via the Swift Package Manager. Just add it to your `Package.swift` file: ```swift dependencies: [ .package(url: "" exact: ""1.0.0-ALPHA-31"") ], targets: [ .target( name: ""MyTargetName"", dependencies: [ // Swift Concurrency implementation .product(name: ""KMPNativeCoroutinesAsync"", package: ""KMP-NativeCoroutines""), // Combine implementation .product(name: ""KMPNativeCoroutinesCombine"", package: ""KMP-NativeCoroutines""), // RxSwift implementation .product(name: ""KMPNativeCoroutinesRxSwift"", package: ""KMP-NativeCoroutines"") ] ) ] ``` Or add it in Xcode by going to `File` > `Add Packages...` and providing the URL: ` > [!NOTE] > The version for the Swift package should not contain the Kotlin version suffix > (e.g. `-new-mm` or `-kotlin-1.6.0`). > [!NOTE] > If you only need a single implementation you can also use the SPM specific versions with suffixes > `-spm-async`, `-spm-combine` and `-spm-rxswift`. ### Swift (CocoaPods) If you use CocoaPods add one or more of the following libraries to your `Podfile`: ```ruby pod 'KMPNativeCoroutinesAsync', '1.0.0-ALPHA-31' # Swift Concurrency implementation pod 'KMPNativeCoroutinesCombine', '1.0.0-ALPHA-31' # Combine implementation pod 'KMPNativeCoroutinesRxSwift', '1.0.0-ALPHA-31' # RxSwift implementation ``` > [!NOTE] > The version for CocoaPods should not contain the Kotlin version suffix (e.g. `-new-mm` or `-kotlin-1.6.0`). ### IntelliJ / Android Studio Install the [IDE plugin]( from the JetBrains Marketplace to get: * Annotation usage validation * Exposed coroutines warnings * Quick fixes to add annotations ## Usage Using your Kotlin Coroutines code from Swift is almost as easy as calling the Kotlin code. Just use the wrapper functions in Swift to get async functions, AsyncStreams, Publishers or Observables. ### Kotlin The plugin will automagically generate the necessary code for you! Just annotate your coroutines declarations with `@NativeCoroutines` (or `@NativeCoroutinesState`). #### Flows Your `Flow` properties/functions get a native version: ```kotlin import com.rickclephas.kmp.nativecoroutines.NativeCoroutines class Clock { // Somewhere in your Kotlin code you define a Flow property // and annotate it with @NativeCoroutines @NativeCoroutines val time: StateFlow // This can be any kind of Flow } ``` Generated code The plugin will generate this native property for you: ```kotlin import com.rickclephas.kmp.nativecoroutines.asNativeFlow import kotlin.native.ObjCName @ObjCName(name = ""time"") val Clock.timeNative get() = time.asNativeFlow() ``` For the `StateFlow` defined above the plugin will also generate this value property: ```kotlin val Clock.timeValue get() = time.value ``` In case of a `SharedFlow` the plugin would generate a replay cache property: ```kotlin val Clock.timeReplayCache get() = time.replayCache ``` #### StateFlows Using `StateFlow` properties to track state (like in a view model)? Use the `@NativeCoroutinesState` annotation instead: ```kotlin import com.rickclephas.kmp.nativecoroutines.NativeCoroutinesState class Clock { // Somewhere in your Kotlin code you define a StateFlow property // and annotate it with @NativeCoroutinesState @NativeCoroutinesState val time: StateFlow // This must be a StateFlow } ``` Generated code The plugin will generate these native properties for you: ```kotlin import com.rickclephas.kmp.nativecoroutines.asNativeFlow import kotlin.native.ObjCName @ObjCName(name = ""time"") val Clock.timeValue get() = time.value val Clock.timeFlow get() = time.asNativeFlow() ``` #### Suspend functions The plugin also generates native versions for your annotated suspend functions: ```kotlin import com.rickclephas.kmp.nativecoroutines.NativeCoroutines class RandomLettersGenerator { // Somewhere in your Kotlin code you define a suspend function // and annotate it with @NativeCoroutines @NativeCoroutines suspend fun getRandomLetters(): String { // Code to generate some random letters } } ``` Generated code The plugin will generate this native function for you: ```kotlin import com.rickclephas.kmp.nativecoroutines.nativeSuspend import kotlin.native.ObjCName @ObjCName(name = ""getRandomLetters"") fun RandomLettersGenerator.getRandomLettersNative() = nativeSuspend { getRandomLetters() } ``` #### Interface limitations Unfortunately extension functions/properties aren't [supported]( on Objective-C protocols. However this limitation can be ""overcome"" with some Swift magic. Assuming `RandomLettersGenerator` is an `interface` instead of a `class` we can do the following: ```swift import KMPNativeCoroutinesCore extension RandomLettersGenerator { func getRandomLetters() -> NativeSuspend { RandomLettersGeneratorNativeKt.getRandomLetters(self) } } ``` #### Exposed coroutines checks When suspend functions and/or `Flow` declarations are exposed to ObjC/Swift, the compiler and IDE plugin will produce a warning, reminding you to add one of the KMP-NativeCoroutines annotations. You can customise the severity of these checks in your `build.gradle.kts` file: ```kotlin nativeCoroutines { exposedSeverity = ExposedSeverity.ERROR } ``` Or, if you are not interested in these checks, disable them: ```kotlin nativeCoroutines { exposedSeverity = ExposedSeverity.NONE } ``` ### Swift Concurrency The Async implementation provides some functions to get async Swift functions and `AsyncSequence`s. #### Async functions Use the `asyncFunction(for:)` function to get an async function that can be awaited: ```swift import KMPNativeCoroutinesAsync let handle = Task { do { let letters = try await asyncFunction(for: randomLettersGenerator.getRandomLetters()) print(""Got random letters: \(letters)"") } catch { print(""Failed with error: \(error)"") } } // To cancel the suspend function just cancel the async task handle.cancel() ``` or if you don't like these do-catches you can use the `asyncResult(for:)` function: ```swift import KMPNativeCoroutinesAsync let result = await asyncResult(for: randomLettersGenerator.getRandomLetters()) if case let .success(letters) = result { print(""Got random letters: \(letters)"") } ``` #### AsyncSequence For `Flow`s there is the `asyncSequence(for:)` function to get an `AsyncSequence`: ```swift import KMPNativeCoroutinesAsync let handle = Task { do { let sequence = asyncSequence(for: randomLettersGenerator.getRandomLettersFlow()) for try await letters in sequence { print(""Got random letters: \(letters)"") } } catch { print(""Failed with error: \(error)"") } } // To cancel the flow (collection) just cancel the async task handle.cancel() ``` ### Combine The Combine implementation provides a couple functions to get an `AnyPublisher` for your Coroutines code. > [!NOTE] > These functions create deferred `AnyPublisher`s. > Meaning every subscription will trigger the collection of the `Flow` or execution of the suspend function. #### Publisher For your `Flow`s use the `createPublisher(for:)` f...

Academy]( describing MockK from the very basics of mocking up to description of all advanced features. - [Basics]( - [Expected behavior and behavior verification]( - [MockK features]( - [MockK advanced features]( - [Testing Quarkus with Kotlin, JUnit and MockK]( - [Unraveling MockK's black magic(EN, translation)]( - [Mockk Guidebook]( - [Kotlin Unit Testing with Mockk by Marco Cattaneo]( - [(Video) Use verify in MockK to validate function calls on mocked object]( - [Testing With MockK paid course on raywenderlich.com]( - TDD for Android video tutorial [part 1]( [part 2]( by Ryan Kay - [(Video)Android Developer Live Coding #13: Unit Testing with Mockk, Coroutines, Test Driven Development]( - [KotlinConf 2018 - Best Practices for Unit Testing in Kotlin by Philipp Hauer]( - [kotlin-fullstack-sample uses MockK]( project covered with tests - [DZone article]( - [Habrahabr article]( (RU) - [Mocking in Kotlin with MockK - Yannick De Turck]( ### Japanese guides and articles - [Documentation translation to Japanese]( - [Unraveling MockK's black magic / MockK (JP, but readable through chrome translator)]( ### Chinese guides and articles - [ Kotlin + Mockito ]( - [MockK mockk, every, Annotation, verify]( - [MockK Relaxed Mocks, Verify, Capture]( - [ Static Method, Singleton]( ### Korean guides and articles - [Documentation translation to Korean]( - [MockK !]( ## Features ### Annotations You can use annotations to simplify the creation of mock objects: ```kotlin class TrafficSystem { lateinit var car1: Car lateinit var car2: Car lateinit var car3: Car } class CarTest { @MockK lateinit var car1: Car @RelaxedMockK lateinit var car2: Car @MockK(relaxUnitFun = true) lateinit var car3: Car @SpyK var car4 = Car() @InjectMockKs var trafficSystem = TrafficSystem() @Before fun setUp() = MockKAnnotations.init(this, relaxUnitFun = true) // turn relaxUnitFun on for all mocks @Test fun calculateAddsValues1() { // ... use car1, car2, car3 and car4 } } ``` Injection first tries to match properties by name, then by class or superclass. Check the `lookupType` parameter for customization. Properties are injected even if `private` is applied. Constructors for injection are selected from the biggest number of arguments to lowest. `@InjectMockKs` by default injects only `lateinit var`s or `var`s that are not assigned. To change this, use `overrideValues = true`. This would assign the value even if it is already initialized somehow. To inject `val`s, use `injectImmutable = true`. For a shorter notation use `@OverrideMockKs` which does the same as `@InjectMockKs` by default, but turns these two flags on. ### JUnit4 JUnit 4 exposes a rule-based API to allow for some automation following the test lifecycle. MockK includes a rule which uses this to set up and tear down your mocks without needing to manually call `MockKAnnotations.init(this)`. Example: ```kotlin class CarTest { @get:Rule val mockkRule = MockKRule(this) @MockK lateinit var car1: Car @RelaxedMockK lateinit var car2: Car @Test fun something() { every { car1.drive() } just runs every { car2.changeGear(any()) } returns true // etc } } ``` #### JUnit5 In JUnit5 you can use `MockKExtension` to initialize your mocks. ```kotlin @ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class) class CarTest { @MockK lateinit var car1: Car @RelaxedMockK lateinit var car2: Car @MockK(relaxUnitFun = true) lateinit var car3: Car @SpyK var car4 = Car() @Test fun calculateAddsValues1() { // ... use car1, car2, car3 and car4 } } ``` Additionally, it adds the possibility to use `@MockK` and `@RelaxedMockK` on test function parameters: ```kotlin @Test fun calculateAddsValues1(@MockK car1: Car, @RelaxedMockK car2: Car) { // ... use car1 and car2 } ``` Finally, this extension will call `unmockkAll` and `clearAllMocks` in a `@AfterAll` callback, ensuring your test environment is clean after each test class execution. You can disable this behavior by adding the `@MockKExtension.KeepMocks` annotation to your class or globally by setting the `mockk.junit.extension.keepmocks=true` property. (Since v1.13.11) Alternatively, since `clearAllMocks` is not thread-safe, if you need to run test in parallel you can add the `MockKExtension.RequireParallelTesting` annotation to your class or set the `mockk.junit.extension.requireParallelTesting=true` property to disable calling it in the `@AfterAll` callback. #### Automatic verification confirmation You can make sure that all stubbed methods are actually verified by also annotating your test class with `@MockKExtension.ConfirmVerification`. This will internally call `confirmVerified` on all mocks after each test, to make sure there are no unnecessary stubbings. Please note that this behavior may not work as expected when running tests in your IDE, as it is Gradle who takes care of handling the exception being thrown when these `confirmVerified` calls fail. #### Automatic unnecessary stubbing check You can make sure that all stubbed methods are useful - used at least once - by also annotating your test class with `@MockKExtension.CheckUnnecessaryStub`. This will internally call `checkUnnecessaryStub` on all mocks after each test, to make sure there are no unnecessary stubbings. ### Spy Spies allow you to mix mocks and real objects. ```kotlin val car = spyk(Car()) // or spyk() to call the default constructor car.drive(Direction.NORTH) // returns whatever the real function of Car returns verify { car.drive(Direction.NORTH) } confirmVerified(car) ``` Note 1: the spy object is a copy of the passed object. Note 2: there is a known issue if using a spy with a suspending function: ### Relaxed mock A `relaxed mock` is the mock that returns some simple value for all functions. This allows you to skip specifying behavior for each case, while still stubbing things you need. For reference types, chained mocks are returned. ```kotlin val car = mockk(relaxed = true) car.drive(Direction.NORTH) // returns null verify { car.drive(Direction.NORTH) } confirmVerified(car) ``` Note: relaxed mocking is working badly with generic return types. A class cast exception is usually thrown in this case. Opt for stubbing manually in the case of a generic return type. Workaround: ```kotlin val func = mockk<() -> Car>(relaxed = true) // in this case invoke function has generic return type // this line is workaround, without it the relaxed mock would throw a class cast exception on the next line every { func() } returns Car() // or you can return mockk() for example func() ``` ### Partial mocking Sometimes, you need to stub some functions, but still call the real method on others, or on specific arguments. This is possible by passing `callOriginal()` to `answers`, which works for both relaxed and non-relaxed mocks. ```kotlin class Adder { fun addOne(num: Int) = num + 1 } val adder = mockk() every { adder.addOne(any()) } returns -1 every { adder.addOne(3) } answers { callOriginal() } assertEquals(-1, adder.addOne(2)) assertEquals(4, adder.addOne(3)) // original function is called ``` ### Mock relaxed for functions returning Unit If you want `Unit`-returning functions to be relaxed, you can use `relaxUnitFun = true` as an argument to the `mockk` function, `@MockK`annotation or `MockKAnnotations.init` function. Function: ```kotlin mockk(relaxUnitFun = true) ``` Annotation: ```kotlin @MockK(relaxUnitFun = true) lateinit var mock1: ClassBeingMocked init { MockKAnnotations.init(this) } ``` MockKAnnotations.init: ```kotlin @MockK lateinit var mock2: ClassBeingMocked init { MockKAnnotations.init(this, relaxUnitFun = true) } ``` ### Object mocks Objects can be turned into mocks in the following way: ```kotlin object ObjBeingMocked { fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b } mockkObject(ObjBeingMocked) // applies mocking to an Object assertEquals(3, ObjBeingMocked.add(1, 2)) every { ObjBeingMocked.add(1, 2) } returns 55 assertEquals(55, ObjBeingMocked.add(1, 2)) ``` To revert back, use `unmockkObject` or `unmockkAll` (more destructive: cancels object, static and constructor mocks) ```kotlin @Before f...

There are no API changes. If you find any issue migrating to v.1.0.0 , please follow this [Guide]( If you still facing the issue than you can always rollback to [v.0.4.0]( Any fix in PR are Welcome :) ### Kotlin PhotoEditor [v.2.0.0]( is fully migrated to Kotlin. You can use [v.1.5.1]( for the Java version. There are no breaking API changes in these two versions. ## Setting up the View First we need to add `PhotoEditorView` in our xml layout ```xml ``` We can define our drawable or color resource directly using `app:photo_src` We can set the image programmatically by getting source from `PhotoEditorView` which will return a `ImageView` so that we can load image from resources,file or (Picasso/Glide) ```java PhotoEditorView mPhotoEditorView = findViewById(R.id.photoEditorView); mPhotoEditorView.getSource().setImageResource(R.drawable.got); ``` ## Building a PhotoEditor To use the image editing feature we need to build a PhotoEditor which requires a Context and PhotoEditorView which we have to setup in our xml layout ```java //Use custom font using latest support library Typeface mTextRobotoTf = ResourcesCompat.getFont(this, R.font.roboto_medium); //loading font from asset Typeface mEmojiTypeFace = Typeface.createFromAsset(getAssets(), ""emojione-android.ttf""); mPhotoEditor = new PhotoEditor.Builder(this, mPhotoEditorView) .setPinchTextScalable(true) .setClipSourceImage(true) .setDefaultTextTypeface(mTextRobotoTf) .setDefaultEmojiTypeface(mEmojiTypeFace) .build(); ``` We can customize the properties in the PhotoEditor as per our requirement | Property | Usage | | ------------- | ------------- | | `setPinchTextScalable()` | set false to disable pinch to zoom on text insertion. Default: true. | | `setClipSourceImage()` | set true to clip the drawing brush to the source image. Default: false. | | `setDefaultTextTypeface()` | set default text font to be added on image | | `setDefaultEmojiTypeface()` | set default font specifc to add emojis | That's it we are done with setting up our library ## Drawing We can customize our brush and paint with different set of property. To start drawing on image we need to enable the drawing mode | Type | Method | |----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Enable/Disable | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushDrawingMode(true);` | | Shape (brush, line, oval, rectangle, arrow) | `mPhotoEditor.addShape(shape)` | | Shape size (px) | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushSize(brushSize)` or through the a ShapeBuilder | | Shape opacity (In %) | `mPhotoEditor.setOpacity(opacity)` or through the a ShapeBuilder | | Shape color | `mPhotoEditor.setBrushColor(colorCode)` or through the a ShapeBuilder | | Brush Eraser | `mPhotoEditor.brushEraser()` | **Note**: Whenever we set any property of a brush for drawing it will automatically enable the drawing mode ## Shapes We can draw shapes from [v.1.5.0]( We use `ShapeBuilder` to define shape and other properties. ```kotlin val shapeBuilder = ShapeBuilder() .withShapeOpacity(100) .withShapeType(ShapeType.Oval) .withShapeSize(50f); photoEditor.setShape(mShapeBuilder) ``` For more details check [ShapeBuilder]( ## Filter Effect We can apply inbuild filter to the source images using `mPhotoEditor.setFilterEffect(PhotoFilter.BRIGHTNESS);` We can also apply custom effect using `Custom.Builder` For more details check [Custom Filters]( ## Text We can add the text with inputText and colorCode like this `mPhotoEditor.addText(inputText, colorCode);` It will take default fonts provided in the builder. If we want different fonts for different text we can set typeface with each text like this `mPhotoEditor.addText(mTypeface,inputText, colorCode);` In order to edit the text we need the view, which we will receive in our PhotoEditor callback. This callback will trigger when we **Long Press** the added text ```java mPhotoEditor.setOnPhotoEditorListener(new OnPhotoEditorListener() { @Override public void onEditTextChangeListener(View rootView, String text, int colorCode) { } }); ``` Now we can edit the text with a view like this `mPhotoEditor.editText(rootView, inputText, colorCode);` If you want more customization on text. Please refer the wiki page for more details. ## Emoji We can add the Emoji by `PhotoEditor.getEmojis(getActivity());` which will return a list of emojis unicode. `mPhotoEditor.addEmoji(emojiUnicode);` It will take default fonts provided in the builder. If we want different Emoji fonts for different emoji we can set typeface with each Emoji like this `mPhotoEditor.addEmoji(mEmojiTypeface,emojiUnicode);` ## Adding Images/Stickers We need to provide a Bitmap to add our Images `mPhotoEditor.addImage(bitmap);` ## Undo and Redo ```java mPhotoEditor.undo(); mPhotoEditor.redo(); ``` ## Deleting For deleting a Text/Emoji/Image we can click on the view to toggle the view highlighter box which will have a close icon. So, by clicking on the icon we can delete the view. ## Saving In [v.3.0.0]( onward, we can save an image to a file using coroutines: ```kotlin // Please note that if you call this from a fragment, you should call // 'viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch' instead. lifecycleScope.launch { val result = photoEditor.saveAsFile(filePath) if (result is SaveFileResult.Success) { showSnackbar(""Image saved!"") } else { showSnackbar(""Couldn't save image"") } } ``` You can also save an image to a file from Java. We need to provide a file with callback method when edited image is saved. ```java mPhotoEditor.saveAsFile(filePath, new PhotoEditor.OnSaveListener() { @Override public void onSuccess(@NonNull String imagePath) { Log.e(""PhotoEditor"",""Image Saved Successfully""); } @Override public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception exception) { Log.e(""PhotoEditor"",""Failed to save Image""); } }); ``` For more details see [Saving]( ## How to contribute? * Check out contribution guidelines [CONTRIBUTING.md]( ## Questions?

If this library has saved your time then showing a little credit will increase my motivation towards making the library better :) Does it support the CROP feature? Currently, No. I started to build in branch [PE-79]( But due to time constraint, I drop the idea. Any PR related to CROP is welcomed :) Facing issues in applying Filter? The filter effect is applied using `GlSurfaceView` and the implementation of this feature causing a lot of issues. Need to think of some other alternative solution. Here is the issue [list]( Does is support in other platforms (iOS, Web, Flutter)? No. Currently, the focus is on making the android library better.

flutter_rust_bridge,fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge,3627,"['Dart', 'Rust', 'C']","['dart', 'flutter', 'rust', 'bindgen', 'ffi']","# [flutter_rust_bridge v2]( Flutter/Dart <-> Rust binding generator, feature-rich, but seamless and simple. []( []( []( []( []( []( [](#contributors-) []( []( ## What's new in V2 Click to expand * **Rapid setup**: Only a one-liner command to integrate into your project. * **Arbitrary types**: Use arbitrary Rust and Dart types without manual intervention, even if they are not serializable or non-clone (previously need some manual intervention). * **Async Rust**: Support asynchronous Rust (`async fn`), in addition to sync Rust / async Dart / sync Dart. * **Rust call Dart**: Allow Rust to call Dart functions (previously only allow Dart to call Rust). * **Support whole folders as inputs**: Previously only support one single file (e.g. `api.rs`). * **Use libraries/tools in Flutter/Rust**: All existing libraries, Flutter debuggers, ... Nothing to stop you from using them. * **New codec**: A new codec, `SSE`, which is several times faster under typical workload. Please visit [this page]( for more information and update guide. I want to keep it in beta for a while (though CI has all passed), to allow publishing API breaking changes, and hear your thoughts and suggestions about it! ## What's this? * Just write down some ***normal*** Rust code (even with arbitrary types, closure, `&mut`, async, etc) * And call it from Flutter, as if Rust code is ***normal*** Flutter code * The bridge will generate all needed glues in between ## Quickstart Create a working Flutter + Rust app and see it live, by running: ```shell cargo install 'flutter_rust_bridge_codegen@^2.0.0-dev.0' && \ flutter_rust_bridge_codegen create my_app && cd my_app && flutter run ``` **(Optional)** Edit `rust/src/api/simple.rs` (e.g. `Hello` -> `Hi`), then see the change by: ```shell flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate && flutter run ``` For more elaborated quickstart, please visit [this page]( ## Advantages ### 1. Officially `Flutter Favorite` This package is [officially Flutter Favorite]( and is in the first batch of 7 packages at its [rebooting]( ### 2. Simplicity * **Rapid setup**: Only a one-liner command to integrate into your project. * **Write your code naturally**: Use your intuition and write the code you want. The bridge understands many advanced grammars (see below), allowing seamless calling Rust from Dart. * **Use libraries/tools in Flutter/Rust**: All existing libraries, Flutter debuggers, ... Nothing to stop you from using them. * **Battery included**: Even small things like logging and enable backtraces are configured in the starter kit. ### 3. Powerfulness * **Arbitrary types**: Use arbitrary Rust and Dart types without manual intervention, even if they are not serializable or non-clone. * **Async & sync** x Rust & Dart: Multi modes for various needs - Async Dart to avoid blocking the main thread, sync Dart for places needed (e.g. Widget.build); async Rust for IO bound tasks, thread pools for CPU-heavy computations. * **Two-way road**: Not only can Dart call Rust - Rust can also call Dart. * **Auto-translatable types**: Lots of types can be further translated to Dart native types, e.g. complex `enum`s and `struct`s, zero-copy big arrays, errors (`Result`), and `Stream`s (iterator). * **Auto safety**: Focus on your code, and forget memory safety, malloc/free, or undefined behavior completely. * **Customizable & bare-metal mode**: Provide sensible defaults, but everything (loader, handler, ...) can be customized. You can even throw all away and only use the bare minimum calling. * **Cross-platform**: Support Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Web. * Other features, e.g. support whole folders as input, pure-Dart compatible, instance and static methods, ... ### 4. Reliability * **Solid CI**: Valgrind & sanitizers (ASAN/MSAN/LSAN) for memory/UB-related bugs, testing per platform per mode, benchmarking, test coverage, post-release, etc, all guaranteed by CI. * **Used by many people**: See [here]( for an incomplete list. * **Easy to code-review & convince yourself**: This package simply simulates how humans write boilerplate code. If you want to convince yourself (or your team) that it is safe, there is not much code to track. * **Fast**: It is only a thin (though feature-rich) wrapper, benchmarked on CI, and even has multiple codecs for best performance under different workloads. * **Hackable**: If (for whatever reason) you want to hack the source, there are contributor guides, code is modular, and the execution logic is intuitive. * **Ask questions**: Feel free to ask questions in the issue tracker, and I usually reply within hours (if not sleeping). ### Why Flutter + Rust? Click to expand Firstly, super briefly introduce each component (you can find much more in a lot of blogs and posts): * **[Flutter]( Cross-platform, hot-reload, rapid-development, flexible UI toolkit. * ""The most popular cross-platform mobile SDK"" (by StackOverflow [[1]]( * **[Rust]( Highly efficient and performant, reliable, productive. * ""The most desired programming language"" for 8 years (by StackOverflow and GitHub [[1]]( Typical scenarios to combine them include: * **UI framework for Rust**: When you want a UI framework for your Rust system. * **Use arbitrary Rust libraries in Flutter**: When the desired functionality only has a library in Rust, not Dart (Flutter). * **Need high-performance code for Flutter**: Rust makes it easy and performant to write multi-thread code, algorithms, data-intensive operations, SIMD code, etc. * ... ## Show me the code ### Example 1: Simple Simple Rust... ```rust fn f(a: String, b: Vec) -> MyStruct { ... } ``` ...called from Dart, without manual intervention. ```dart print(f(a: 'Hello', b: ['Tom'])); ``` ### Example 2: Show off skills ;) Let's see how fancy we can support: ```rust // Arbitrarily fancy Rust types struct Garden { land: whatever::fancy::Land } // Complex but auto-translatable enum Tree { A { name: (String, i32), children: Option> }, B } // Support functions & methods impl Garden { // Allow async & sync Rust async fn plant( // Support T/&T/&mut T &mut self, tree: Tree, // Rust can also call Dart chooser: impl Fn(String) -> bool, // Error translation ; zero copy ) -> Result, FancyError> { ... } } ``` Still seamlessly call in Dart: ```dart var tree = Tree.a(('x', 42), [Tree.b()]); // Async & sync Dart print(await garden.plant(tree, (a) => true)); ``` ## Documentation Check out [the documentation]( for [quickstart]( [full guides]( and more. ## P.S. Achieve ~60 FPS, no matter how janky the Flutter app was due to build/layout Here is my another open-source library :) ## Acknowledgments and contributors Firstly, I want to sincerely thank Dart, Flutter and Rust (alphabetical order). Dart provides a solid foundation for productive UI development, Flutter enables developers to make cross-platform apps with ease, and Rust empowers everyone to build reliable and efficient software. Without the languages and frameworks, this bridge connects absolutely nothing. Besides, I also want to express my thanks for conferring the official [Flutter Favorite]( honor to the package. In addition, I also want to say thanks to the Dart, Flutter and Rust team members as well as community members, who have helped me during the development of flutter_rust_bridge by valuable discussions, insights, and actions.

realm-dart,realm/realm-dart,724,"['Dart', 'C', 'C++']","['mobile', 'database', 'cross-platform', 'dart', 'flutter']","[](LICENSE) []( []( Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables. This repository holds the source code for the Realm SDK for Flutter and Dart. ## Features * **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets, and wearables. * **Simple:** Realms object-oriented data model is simple to learn, doesnt need an ORM, and the [API]( lets you write less code to get apps up & running in minutes. * **Modern:** Realm supports latest Dart and Flutter versions and is built with sound null-safety. * **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations while maintaining an extremely rich feature set. * **[MongoDB Atlas Device Sync]( Makes it simple to keep data in sync across users, devices, and your backend in real-time. Get started for free with [a template application]( and [create the cloud backend]( ## Getting Started * Import Realm in a dart file `app.dart` ```dart import 'package:realm/realm.dart'; // import realm package part 'app.realm.dart'; // declare a part file. @RealmModel() // define a data model class named `_Car`. class _Car { late String make; late String model; int? kilometers = 500; } ``` * Generate RealmObject class `Car` from data model class `_Car`. ``` dart run realm generate ``` * Open a Realm and add some objects. ```dart var config = Configuration.local([Car.schema]); var realm = Realm(config); var car = Car(""Tesla"", ""Model Y"", kilometers: 5); realm.write(() { realm.add(car); }); ``` * Query objects in Realm. ```dart var cars = realm.all(); Car myCar = cars[0]; print(""My car is ${myCar.make} model ${myCar.model}""); cars = realm.all().query(""make == 'Tesla'""); ``` * Get stream of result changes for a query. ```dart final cars = realm.all().query(r'make == $0', ['Tesla']); cars.changes.listen((changes) { print('Inserted indexes: ${changes.inserted}'); print('Deleted indexes: ${changes.deleted}'); print('Modified indexes: ${changes.modified}'); }); realm.write(() => realm.add(Car('VW', 'Polo', kilometers: 22000))); ``` ## Samples For complete samples check the [Realm Flutter and Dart Samples]( ## Documentation For API documentation go to * [Realm Flutter API Docs]( * [Realm Dart API Docs]( Use [realm]( package for Flutter and [realm_dart]( package for Dart applications. For complete documentation of the SDKs, go to the [Realm SDK documentation]( If you are using the Realm SDK for the first time, refer to the [Quick Start documentation]( To learn more about using Realm with Atlas App Services and Device Sync, refer to the following Realm SDK documentation: - [App Services Overview]( - [Device Sync Overview]( # Realm Flutter SDK Realm Flutter package is published to [realm]( ## Environment setup for Realm Flutter * Realm Flutter supports the platforms iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS and Linux. * Flutter 3.10.2 or newer. * For Flutter Desktop environment setup, see [Desktop support for Flutter]( * Cocoapods v1.11 or newer. * CMake 3.21 or newer. ## Usage **The full contents of `catalog.dart` is listed [after the usage]( * Add `realm` package to a Flutter application. ``` flutter pub add realm ``` * For running Flutter widget and unit tests run the following command to install the required native binaries. ``` dart run realm install ``` * Import Realm in a dart file (ex. `catalog.dart`). ```dart import 'package:realm/realm.dart'; ``` * Declare a part file `catalog.realm.dart` in the begining of the `catalog.dart` dart file after all imports. ```dart import 'dart:io'; part 'catalog.realm.dart'; ``` * Create a data model class. It should start with an underscore `_Item` and be annotated with `@RealmModel()` ```dart @RealmModel() class _Item { @PrimaryKey() late int id; late String name; int price = 42; } ``` * Generate RealmObject class `Item` from data model class `_Item`. _*On Flutter use `dart run realm` to run `realm` package commands*_ ``` dart run realm generate ``` A new file `catalog.realm.dart` will be created next to the `catalog.dart`. _*The generated file should be committed to source control_ * Use the RealmObject class `Item` with Realm. ```dart // Create a Configuration object var config = Configuration.local([Item.schema]); // Opean a Realm var realm = Realm(config); var myItem = Item(0, 'Pen', price: 4); // Open a write transaction realm.write(() { realm.add(myItem); var item = realm.add(Item(1, 'Pencil')..price = 20); }); // Objects `myItem` and `item` are now managed and persisted in the realm // Read object properties from realm print(myItem.name); print(myItem.price); // Update object properties realm.write(() { myItem.price = 20; myItem.name = ""Special Pencil""; }); // Get objects from the realm // Get all objects of type var items = realm.all(); // Get object by index var item = items[1]; // Get object by primary key var itemByKey = realm.find(0); // Filter and sort object var objects = realm.query(""name == 'Special Pencil'""); var name = 'Pen'; objects = realm.query(r'name == $0', [name]); // Close the realm realm.close(); ``` ## Full contents of `catalog.dart` ```dart import 'package:realm/realm.dart'; part 'catalog.realm.dart'; @RealmModel() class _Item { @PrimaryKey() late int id; late String name; int price = 42; } // Create a Configuration object var config = Configuration.local([Item.schema]); // Open a Realm var realm = Realm(config); var myItem = Item(0, 'Pen', price: 4); // Open a write transaction realm.write(() { realm.add(myItem); var item = realm.add(Item(1, 'Pencil')..price = 20); }); // Objects `myItem` and `item` are now managed and persisted in the realm // Read object properties from realm print(myItem.name); print(myItem.price); // Update object properties realm.write(() { myItem.price = 20; myItem.name = ""Special Pencil""; }); // Get objects from the realm // Get all objects of type var items = realm.all(); // Get object by index var item = items[1]; // Get object by primary key var itemByKey = realm.find(0); // Filter and sort object var objects = realm.query(""name == 'Special Pencil'""); var name = 'Pen'; objects = realm.query(r'name == $0', [name]); // Close the realm realm.close(); ``` # Realm Dart Standalone SDK Realm Dart package is published to [realm_dart]( ## Environment setup for Realm Dart * Realm Dart supports the platforms Windows, Mac and Linux. * Dart SDK 3.0.2 or newer. ## Usage * Add `realm_dart` package to a Dart application. ``` dart pub add realm_dart ``` * Install the `realm_dart` package into the application. This downloads and copies the required native binaries to the app directory. ``` dart run realm_dart install ``` * Import realm_dart in a dart file (ex. `catalog.dart`). ```dart import 'package:realm_dart/realm.dart'; ``` * To generate RealmObject classes with realm_dart use this command. _*On Dart use `dart run realm_dart` to run `realm_dart` package commands*_ ``` dart run realm_dart generate ``` A new file `catalog.realm.dart` will be created next to the `catalog.dart`. _*The generated file should be committed to source control_ * The usage of the Realm Dart SDK is the same like the Realm Flutter above. # Sync data with Realm Flutter and Dart using Device Sync This section is about how to use the Realm with [Device Sync]( and how to connect to [Atlas App Services]( ### I. Set up Atlas App Services 1. Create an account on [cloud.mongodb.com]( Follow the instructions: [Register a new Atlas Account]( 1. Create a new App following the instructions here: [Create an App with Atlas App Services UI]( 1. Read [Authentication Providers]( to see how to configure the appropriate authentication provider type. 1. Go to the **Device Sync** menu and [Enable Flexible Sync]( 1. [Find and Copy the App ID]( of your new application. ### II. Use Device Sync with the Realm 1. Initialize the App Services `App` client and authenticate a user. ``` dart String appId = """"; final appConfig = AppConfiguration(appId); final app = App(appConfig); final user = await app.logIn(Credentials.anonymous()); ``` 1. Open a synced realm. ``` dart final config = Configuration.flexibleSync(user, [Task.schema]); final realm = Realm(config); ``` 1. Add a sync subscription and write data. Only data matching the query in the subscription will be synced to the server and only data matching the subscription will be downloaded to the local device realm file. ``` dart realm.subscriptions.update((mutableSubscriptions) { mutableSubscriptions.add(realm.query(r'status == $0 AND progressMinutes == $1', [""completed"", 100])); }); await realm.subscriptions.waitForSynchronization(); realm.write(() { realm.add(Task(ObjectId(), ""Send an email"", ""completed"", 4)); realm.add(Task(ObjectId(), ""Create a meeting"", ""completed"", 100)); realm.add(Task(ObjectId(), ""Call the manager"", ""init"", 2)); }); realm.close(); ``` To learn more about how to sync data with Realm using Device Sync, refer to the [Quick Start with Sync documentation]( # Building the source See [CONTRIBUTING.md]( for instructions about building the source. # Code of Conduct This project adheres to the [MongoDB Code of Conduct]( By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

flutter_stripe,flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe,893,"['Dart', 'Kotlin', 'Swift']","['flutter', 'stripe', 'dart']","# Flutter Stripe []( The Stripe Flutter SDK allows you to build delightful payment experiences in your native Android and iOS apps using Flutter. We provide powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details. ## Features **Simplified Security**: We make it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers and remain [PCI compliant]( This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Stripe instead of passing through your server. For more information, see our [Integration Security Guide]( **Apple Pay**: We provide a [seamless integration with Apple Pay]( **Google Pay**: The plugin can easily act as payment provider for the [Pay plugin](#Pay-Plugin-support) that enables you to seamlessly integrate Google Pay or Apple Pay. All you need to do is add your stripe publishable key to the payment profile. **Payment methods**: Accepting more [payment methods]( helps your business expand its global reach and improve checkout conversion. **SCA-Ready**: The SDK automatically performs native [3D Secure authentication]( if needed to comply with [Strong Customer Authentication]( regulation in Europe. **Native UI**: We provide native screens and elements to securely collect payment details on Android and iOS. **Pre-built payments UI**: Learn how to integrate Payment Sheet, the new pre-built payments UI for mobile apps. This pre-built UI lets you accept cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay out of the box, and includes support for saving & reusing cards. #### Recommended usage If you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's]( and [Google's]( guidelines for more information. For all other scenarios you can use this SDK to process payments via Stripe. ## Installation ```sh dart pub add flutter_stripe ``` ### Requirements #### Android This plugin requires several changes to be able to work on Android devices. Please make sure you follow all these steps: 1. Use Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above 2. Use Kotlin version 1.5.0 and above: [example]( 3. Requires Android Gradle plugin 8 and higher 4. Using a descendant of `Theme.AppCompat` for your activity: [example]( [example night theme]( 5. Using an up-to-date Android gradle build tools version: [example]( and an up-to-date gradle version accordingly: [example]( 6. Using `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity` in `MainActivity.kt`: [example]( 7. Add the following rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file: [example]( ```proguard -dontwarn com.stripe.android.pushProvisioning.PushProvisioningActivity$g -dontwarn com.stripe.android.pushProvisioning.PushProvisioningActivityStarter$Args -dontwarn com.stripe.android.pushProvisioning.PushProvisioningActivityStarter$Error -dontwarn com.stripe.android.pushProvisioning.PushProvisioningActivityStarter -dontwarn com.stripe.android.pushProvisioning.PushProvisioningEphemeralKeyProvider ``` 8. Rebuild the app, as the above changes don't update with hot reload These changes are needed because the Android Stripe SDK requires the use of the AppCompat theme for their UI components and the Support Fragment Manager for the Payment Sheets If you are having troubles to make this package to work on Android, join [this discussion]( to get some support. #### iOS Compatible with apps targeting iOS 13 or above. To upgrade your iOS deployment target to 13.0, you can either do so in Xcode under your Build Settings, or by modifying IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET in your project.pbxproj directly. You will also need to update in your Podfile: `platform :ios, '13.0'` For card scanning add the following to your Info.plist: ```xml NSCameraUsageDescription Scan your card to add it automatically NSCameraUsageDescription <string>To scan cards</string> To scan cards ``` #### Web (Experimental) Now you can use Stripe with Flutter web! Notice right now it is highly experimental and only a subset of features is implemented. Namely: - Create paymentmethod - Confirm payment intent - Confirm setup intent - Create token - Confirm payment element (recommended way of handling payments on web) To use Stripe on web, it is required to add `flutter_stripe_web` in your pubspec file ## Usage ### Card payments There are 3 ways of handling card payments Method | Ease of use | description | Implementation docs | ------------- | ------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | Payment sheet | Easy | Our recommended way of handling payments. It offers localization, animations and error handling out of the box. | [docs]( | Cardfield | Medium | Single line cardfield. Offers more flexibility but has less built-in functionality. | [docs]( | Card form | Medium | Similar as the cardfield but the entry fields are spread across multi lines | [docs]( | ### Wallets This library fully supports native Apple Pay and [Google pay]( integration. ### Mobile elements [BETA] We also support the customer sheet mobile element. Check out the [docs]( to learn more on how to set it up. ### Financial connections We also support Financial connections in our latest sdk. Check out the [docs]( to learn more on how to set it up. ## Stripe initialization To initialize Stripe in your Flutter app, use the `Stripe` base class. `Stripe` offers `publishableKey`, `stripeAccountId`, `threeDSecureParams` and `merchantIdentifier`. Only `publishableKey` is required. ## Dart API The library offers several methods to handle stripe related actions: ```dart Future createPaymentMethod(...); Future handleNextAction(...); Future confirmPayment(...); Future configure3dSecure(...); Future isApplePaySupported(); Future presentApplePay(...); Future confirmApplePayPayment(...); Future confirmSetupIntent(...); Future retrievePaymentIntent(...); Future createTokenForCVCUpdate(...); Future initPaymentSheet(...); Future presentPaymentSheet(...); Future confirmPaymentSheetPayment() ``` The example app offers examples on how to use these methods. ## Pay Plugin support flutter_stripe fully supports the [Pay plugin]( from the Google Pay team. By including a few lines you can integrate Stripe as a payment processor for Google / Apple Pay: ```dart Future onGooglePayResult(paymentResult) async { final response = await fetchPaymentIntentClientSecret(); final clientSecret = response['clientSecret']; final token = paymentResult['paymentMethodData']['tokenizationData']['token']; final tokenJson = Map.castFrom(json.decode(token)); final params = PaymentMethodParams.cardFromToken( token: tokenJson['id'], ); // Confirm Google pay payment method await Stripe.instance.confirmPayment( clientSecret, params, ); } ``` ## Run the example app - Navigate to the example folder `cd example` - Install the dependencies - `flutter pub get` - Set up env vars for the flutter app and a local backend. - [Get your test Stripe API keys]( - `cp lib/.env.example.dart lib/.env.dart` and set your Stripe publishable key. - `cp server/.env.example server/.env` and set the variable values in your newly created `.env` file. - Install the server dependencies in the `server` directory: * `cd server` * `npm install` or `yarn --cwd ""server""` - Start the example - Terminal 1: * Move to the `server` directory: `cd server` * Run npm or yarn: `npm start` or `yarn --cwd ""server"" start` - Terminal 2: * Move to the `lib` directory: `cd lib` * Run flutter: `flutter run` ##### Additional steps for webhook forwarding - [Install the `stripe-cli`]( - Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook` ## Contributing You can help us make this project better, feel free to open an new issue or a pull request. ##### Setup This project uses [melos]( to manage all the packages inside this repo. - Install melos: `dart pub global activate melos` - Setup melos in your local folder: `melos bootstrap` ##### Useful commands - Format `melos run format` - Analyze `melos run analyze` - Test `melos run unittest` - Pub get `melos run get` ##### Publishing - Use `melos version` and `melos publish` to keep all the repositories in sync","496, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, needs triage, enhancement, Stripe RN SDK, bug, blocked, iOS, Android, web, Awaiting response, Stripe sdk, documentation, support, javascript, good first issue, duplicate, dependencies, Generic question"
mobile_scanner,juliansteenbakker/mobile_scanner,756,"['Dart', 'Swift', 'Kotlin']","['flutter', 'android', 'ios', 'dart', 'hacktoberfest']","# mobile_scanner []( []( []( []( A universal scanner for Flutter based on MLKit. Uses CameraX on Android and AVFoundation on iOS. ## Breaking Changes v5.0.0 Version 5.0.0 brings some breaking changes. However, some are reverted in version 5.1.0. Please see the list below for all breaking changes, and Changelog.md for a more detailed list. * ~~The `autoStart` attribute has been removed from the `MobileScannerController`. The controller should be manually started on-demand.~~ (Reverted in version 5.1.0) * ~~A controller is now required for the `MobileScanner` widget.~~ (Reverted in version 5.1.0) * ~~The `onDetect` method has been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget. Instead, listen to `MobileScannerController.barcodes` directly.~~ (Reverted in version 5.1.0) * The `width` and `height` of `BarcodeCapture` have been removed, in favor of `size`. * The `raw` attribute is now `Object?` instead of `dynamic`, so that it participates in type promotion. * The `MobileScannerArguments` class has been removed from the public API, as it is an internal type. * The `cameraFacingOverride` named argument for the `start()` method has been renamed to `cameraDirection`. * The `analyzeImage` function now correctly returns a `BarcodeCapture?` instead of a boolean. * The `formats` attribute of the `MobileScannerController` is now non-null. * The `MobileScannerState` enum has been renamed to `MobileScannerAuthorizationState`. * The various `ValueNotifier`s for the camera state have been removed. Use the `value` of the `MobileScannerController` instead. * The `hasTorch` getter has been removed. Instead, use the torch state of the controller's value. * The `TorchState` enum now provides a new value for unavailable flashlights. * The `onPermissionSet`, `onStart` and `onScannerStarted` methods have been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget. Instead, await `MobileScannerController.start()`. * The `startDelay` has been removed from the `MobileScanner` widget. Instead, use a delay between manual starts of one or more controllers. * The `overlay` widget of the `MobileScanner` has been replaced by a new property, `overlayBuilder`, which provides the constraints for the overlay. * The torch can no longer be toggled on the web, as this is only available for image tracks and not video tracks. As a result the torch state for the web will always be `TorchState.unavailable`. * The zoom scale can no longer be modified on the web, as this is only available for image tracks and not video tracks. As a result, the zoom scale will always be `1.0`. ## Features Supported See the example app for detailed implementation information. | Features | Android | iOS | macOS | Web | |------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----| | analyzeImage (Gallery) | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | | returnImage | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | | scanWindow | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | ## Platform Support | Android | iOS | macOS | Web | Linux | Windows | |---------|-----|-------|-----|-------|---------| | | | | | :x: | :x: | ## Platform specific setup ### Android This package uses by default the **bundled version** of MLKit Barcode-scanning for Android. This version is immediately available to the device. But it will increase the size of the app by approximately 3 to 10 MB. The alternative is to use the **unbundled version** of MLKit Barcode-scanning for Android. This version is downloaded on first use via Google Play Services. It increases the app size by around 600KB. [You can read more about the difference between the two versions here.]( To use the **unbundled version** of the MLKit Barcode-scanning, add the following line to your `/android/gradle.properties` file: ``` dev.steenbakker.mobile_scanner.useUnbundled=true ``` ### iOS **Add the following keys to your Info.plist file, located in /ios/Runner/Info.plist:** NSCameraUsageDescription - describe why your app needs access to the camera. This is called Privacy - Camera Usage Description in the visual editor. **If you want to use the local gallery feature from [image_picker]( NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description in the visual editor. Example, ``` NSCameraUsageDescription This app needs camera access to scan QR codes NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription This app needs photos access to get QR code from photo library ``` ### macOS Ensure that you granted camera permission in XCode -> Signing & Capabilities: ## Web As of version 5.0.0 adding the library to the `index.html` is no longer required, as the library is automatically loaded on first use. ### Providing a mirror for the barcode scanning library If a different mirror is needed to load the barcode scanning library, the source URL can be set beforehand. ```dart import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart'; import 'package:mobile_scanner/mobile_scanner.dart'; final String scriptUrl = // ... if (kIsWeb) { MobileScannerPlatform.instance.setBarcodeLibraryScriptUrl(scriptUrl); } ``` ## Usage Import the package with `package:mobile_scanner/mobile_scanner.dart`. Create a new `MobileScannerController` controller, using the required options. Provide a `StreamSubscription` for the barcode events. ```dart final MobileScannerController controller = MobileScannerController( // required options for the scanner ); StreamSubscription? _subscription; ``` Ensure that your `State` class mixes in `WidgetsBindingObserver`, to handle lifecyle changes: ```dart class MyState extends State with WidgetsBindingObserver { // ... @override void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) { // If the controller is not ready, do not try to start or stop it. // Permission dialogs can trigger lifecycle changes before the controller is ready. if (!controller.value.isInitialized) { return; } switch (state) { case AppLifecycleState.detached: case AppLifecycleState.hidden: case AppLifecycleState.paused: return; case AppLifecycleState.resumed: // Restart the scanner when the app is resumed. // Don't forget to resume listening to the barcode events. _subscription = controller.barcodes.listen(_handleBarcode); unawaited(controller.start()); case AppLifecycleState.inactive: // Stop the scanner when the app is paused. // Also stop the barcode events subscription. unawaited(_subscription?.cancel()); _subscription = null; unawaited(controller.stop()); } } // ... } ``` Then, start the scanner in `void initState()`: ```dart @override void initState() { super.initState(); // Start listening to lifecycle changes. WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this); // Start listening to the barcode events. _subscription = controller.barcodes.listen(_handleBarcode); // Finally, start the scanner itself. unawaited(controller.start()); } ``` Finally, dispose of the the `MobileScannerController` when you are done with it. ```dart @override Future dispose() async { // Stop listening to lifecycle changes. WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this); // Stop listening to the barcode events. unawaited(_subscription?.cancel()); _subscription = null; // Dispose the widget itself. super.dispose(); // Finally, dispose of the controller. await controller.dispose(); } ``` To display the camera preview, pass the controller to a `MobileScanner` widget. See the [examples](example/README.md) for runnable examples of various usages, such as the basic usage, applying a scan window, or retrieving images from the barcodes.","446, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, ios, enhancement, android, bug, web, pdf417, MLKit, scanWindow, recognition, permissions, macos, landscape mode, flashlight, dependencies, symbiology, lifecycle, help wanted, good first issue, documentation, camera status, black screen, windows, v3.0.0, rear camera, question, portrait mode, layout, java, ipad, interaction with hardware"

font_awesome_flutter,fluttercommunity/font_awesome_flutter,824,"['Dart', 'HTML', 'Objective-C']","['flutter', 'flutter-icons', 'font-awesome', 'hacktoberfest']","# font_awesome_flutter []( []( The *free* [Font Awesome]( Icon pack available as set of Flutter Icons - based on font awesome version 6.5.1. This icon pack includes only the *free* icons offered by Font Awesome out-of-the-box. If you have purchased the pro icons and want to enable support for them, please see the instructions below. ## Installation In the `dependencies:` section of your `pubspec.yaml`, add the following line: ```yaml dependencies: font_awesome_flutter: ``` ## Usage ```dart import 'package:font_awesome_flutter/font_awesome_flutter.dart'; class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget { Widget build(BuildContext context) { return IconButton( // Use the FaIcon Widget + FontAwesomeIcons class for the IconData icon: FaIcon(FontAwesomeIcons.gamepad), onPressed: () { print(""Pressed""); } ); } } ``` ### Icon names Icon names equal those on the [official website]( but are written in lower camel case. If more than one icon style is available for an icon, the style name is used as prefix, except for ""regular"". Due to restrictions in dart, icons starting with numbers have those numbers written out. #### Examples: | Icon name | Code | Style| |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --- | ---| | [angle-double-up]( | `FontAwesomeIcons.angleDoubleUp` | solid _(this icon does not have other free styles)_ | | [arrow-alt-circle-up]( | `FontAwesomeIcons.arrowAltCircleUp` | regular | | [arrow-alt-circle-up]( | `FontAwesomeIcons.solidArrowAltCircleUp` | solid | | [1]( | `FontAwesomeIcons.solidOne` | solid | ## Example App View the Flutter app in the `example` directory to see all the available `FontAwesomeIcons`. ## Customizing font awesome flutter We supply a configurator tool to assist you with common customizations to this package. All options are interoperable. By default, if run without arguments and no `icons.json` in `lib/fonts` exists, it updates all icons to the newest free version of font awesome. ### Setup To use your custom version, you must first clone [this repository]( to a location of your choice and run `flutter pub get` inside. This installs all dependencies. The configurator is located in the `util` folder and can be started by running `configurator.bat` on Windows, or `./configurator.sh` on linux and mac. All following examples use the `.sh` version, but work same for `.bat`. (If on windows, omit the `./` or replace it with `.\`.) An overview of available options can be viewed with `./configurator.sh --help`. To use your customized version in an app, go to the app's `pubspec.yaml` and add a dependency for `font_awesome_flutter: '>= 4.7.0'`. Then override the dependency's location: ```yaml dependencies: font_awesome_flutter: '>= 4.7.0' ... dependency_overrides: font_awesome_flutter: path: path/to/your/font_awesome_flutter ... ``` ### Enable pro icons :exclamation: By importing pro icons you acknowledge that it is your obligation to keep these files private. This includes **not** uploading your package to a public github repository or other public file sharing services. * Go to the location of your custom font_awesome_flutter version (see [setup](#setup)) * Download the web version of font awesome pro and open it * Move **all** `.ttf` files from the `webfonts` directory and `icons.json` from `metadata` to `path/to/your/font_awesome_flutter/lib/fonts`. Replace existing files. * Run the configurator. It should say ""Custom icons.json found"" It may be required to run `flutter clean` in apps who use this version for changes to appear. ### Excluding styles One or more styles can be excluded from all generation processes by passing them with the `--exclude` option: ``` $ ./configurator.sh --exclude solid $ ./configurator.sh --exclude solid,brands ``` See the [optimizations](#what-about-file-size-and-ram-usage) and [dynamic icon retrieval by name](#retrieve-icons-dynamically-by-their-name-or-css-class) sections for more information as to why it makes sense for your app. ### Retrieve icons dynamically by their name or css class Probably the most requested feature after support for pro icons is the ability to retrieve an icon by their name. This was previously not possible, because a mapping from name to icon would break all [discussed optimizations](#what-about-file-size-and-ram-usage). Please bear in mind that this is still the case. As all icons could theoretically be requested, none can be removed by flutter. It is strongly advised to only use this option in conjunction with [a limited set of styles](#excluding-styles) and with as few of them as possible. You may need to build your app with the `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag for it to succeed. Using the new configurator tool, this is now an optional feature. Run the tool with the `--dynamic` flag to generate... ``` $ ./configurator.sh --dynamic ``` ...and the following import to use the map. For normal icons, use `faIconNameMapping` with a key of this format: 'style icon-name'. ```dart import 'package:font_awesome_flutter/name_icon_mapping.dart'; ... FaIcon(faIconNameMapping['solid abacus']); ... ``` To exclude unused styles combine the configurator options: ``` $ ./configurator.sh --dynamic --exclude solid ``` A common use case also includes fetching css classes from a server. The utility function `getIconFromCss()` takes a string of classes and returns the icon which would be shown by a browser: ```dart getIconFromCss('far custom-class fa-abacus'); // returns the abacus icon in regular style. custom-class is ignored ``` ## Duotone icons Duotone support has been discontinued after font awesome changed the way they lay out the icon glyphs inside the font's file. The new way using ligatures is not supported by flutter at the moment. For more information on why duotone icon support was discontinued, see [this comment]( ## FAQ Why aren't the icons aligned properly or why are the icons being cut off? Please use the `FaIcon` widget provided by the library instead of the `Icon` widget provided by Flutter. The `Icon` widget assumes all icons are square, but many Font Awesome Icons are not. What about file size and ram usage This package has been written in a way so that it only uses the minimum amount of resources required. All links (eg. `FontAwesomeIcons.abacus`) to unused icons will be removed automatically, which means only required icon definitions are loaded into ram. Flutter 1.22 added icon tree shaking. This means unused icon ""images"" will be removed as well. However, this only applies to styles of which at least one icon has been used. Assuming only icons of style ""regular"" are being used, ""regular"" will be minified to only include the used icons and ""solid"" and ""brands"" will stay in their raw, complete form. This issue is being [tracked over in the flutter repository]( However, using the configurator, you can easily exclude styles from the package. For more information, see [customizing font awesome flutter](#customizing-font-awesome-flutter) Why aren't the icons showing up on Mobile devices? If you're not seeing any icons at all, sometimes it means that Flutter has a cached version of the app on device and hasn't pushed the new fonts. I've run into that as well a few times... Please try: 1. Stopping the app 2. Running `flutter clean` in your app directory 3. Deleting the app from your simulator / emulator / device 4. Rebuild & Deploy the app. Why aren't the icons showing up on Web? Most likely, the fonts were not correctly added to the `FontManifest.json`. Note: older versions of Flutter did not properly package non-Material fonts in the `FontManifest.json` during the build step, but that issue has been resolved and this shouldn't be much of a problem these days. Please ensure you are using `Flutter 1.14.6 beta` or newer! Why does mac/linux not run the configurator? This is most probably due to missing file permissions. Downloaded scripts cannot be executed by default. Either give the execute permission to `util/configurator.sh` with `$ chmod +x configurator.sh` or run the commands by prepending an `sh`: `$ sh ./configurator.sh`","228, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, wontfix, suggestion, question, invalid, help wanted, enhancement, duplicate, bug, Pro icons, Generator, Awaiting reply"

Documentation License --- ## About Splitting up large code bases into separate independently versioned packages is extremely useful for code sharing. However, making changes across many repositories is _messy_ and difficult to track, and testing across repositories gets complicated really fast. To solve these (and many other) problems, some projects will organize their code bases into multi-package repositories (sometimes called [monorepos]( **Melos is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and Pub.** ## What does a Melos workspace look like? A default file structure looks something like this: ``` my-melos-repo/ melos.yaml packages/ package-1/ pubspec.yaml package-2/ pubspec.yaml ``` The location of your packages can be configured via the `melos.yaml` configuration file if the default is unsuitable. ## What can Melos do? - Link local packages in your workspace together without adding dependency overrides. - Automatically version, create changelogs and publish your packages using [Conventional Commits]( - Pre-define advanced custom scripts for your workspace in your `melos.yaml` configuration to use via `melos run [scriptName]`. Anyone contributing to your workspace can just run `melos run` to be prompted to select a script from a list with descriptions of each script. - Scripts can even [prompt to select a package]( to run against with pre-defined filters. - Execute commands across your packages easily with `melos exec -- ` with additional concurrency and fail-fast options. - [Environment variables]( containing various information about the current package and the workspace are available in each execution. - Can be combined with all package filters. - Many advanced package filtering options allowing you to target specific packages or groups of packages in your workspace. - `--no-private` - Exclude private packages (`publish_to: none`). - `--[no-]published` - Filter packages where the current local package version exists on pub.dev. Or ""-no-published"" to filter packages that have not had their current version published yet. - `--[no-]nullsafety` - Filter packages where the current local version uses a ""nullsafety"" prerelease preid. Or ""-no-nullsafety"" to filter packages where their current version does not have a ""nullsafety"" preid. - `--[no-]flutter` - Filter packages where the package depends on the Flutter SDK. Or ""-no-flutter"" to filter packages that do not depend on the Flutter SDK. - `--scope=` - Include only packages with names matching the given glob. - `--ignore=` - Exclude packages with names matching the given glob. - `--diff=` - Only include packages that have been changed since the specified `ref`, e.g. a commit sha or git tag. - `--dir-exists=` - Include only packages where a specific directory exists inside the package. - `--file-exists=` - Include only packages where a specific file exists in the package. - `--depends-on=` - Include only packages that depend on a specific package. - `--no-depends-on=` - Include only packages that _don't_ depend on a specific package. - `--include-dependencies` - Expands the filtered list of packages to include those packages' transitive dependencies (ignoring filters). - `--include-dependents` - Expands the filtered list of packages to include those packages' transitive dependents (ignoring filters). - Advanced support for IntelliJ IDEs with automatic creation of [run configurations for workspace defined scripts and more]( on workspace bootstrap. - Integration with VS Code through an [extension][melos-code]. ## Getting Started Go to the [Getting Started]( page of the [documentation]( to start using Melos. ## Who is using Melos?

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Reusing design patterns helps prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns. # Getting started This site showcases Java Design Patterns. The solutions have been developed by experienced programmers and architects from the open-source community. The patterns can be browsed by their high-level descriptions or by looking at their source code. The source code examples are well commented and can be thought of as programming tutorials on how to implement a specific pattern. We use the most popular battle-proven open-source Java technologies. Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various [Software Design Principles]( All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI, and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical extensibility. Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into the [available design patterns]( by any of the following approaches - Search for a specific pattern by name. Can't find one? Please report a new pattern [here]( - Using tags such as `Performance`, `Gang of Four` or `Data access`. - Using pattern categories, `Creational`, `Behavioral`, and others. Hopefully, you find the object-oriented solutions presented on this site useful in your architectures and have as much fun learning them as we had while developing them. # How to contribute If you are willing to contribute to the project you will find the relevant information in our [developer wiki]( We will help you and answer your questions in the [Gitter chatroom]( # License This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. # Contributors Ilkka Seppl Subhrodip Mohanta amit1307 Narendra Pathai Jeroen Meulemeester Joseph McCarthy Thomas Anurag Agarwal Markus Moser Sabiq Ihab Amit Dixit Piyush Kailash Chaudhari joshzambales Kamil Pietruszka Zafar Khaydarov Paul Campbell Argyro Sioziou TylerMcConville saksham93 nikhilbarar Colin But Ruslan Juho Kang Dheeraj Mummareddy Bernardo Sulzbach Aleksandar Dudukovic Yusuf Ayta Mihly Kuprivecz Stanislav Kapinus GVSharma Sran Paunovi Petros G.

openai-java,TheoKanning/openai-java,4626,"['Java', 'HTML']","['java', 'gpt3', 'openai']","> OpenAI has deprecated all Engine-based APIs. See [Deprecated Endpoints]( below for more info. # OpenAI-Java Java libraries for using OpenAI's GPT apis. Supports GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Includes the following artifacts: - `api` : request/response POJOs for the GPT APIs. - `client` : a basic retrofit client for the GPT endpoints, includes the `api` module - `service` : A basic service class that creates and calls the client. This is the easiest way to get started. as well as an example project using the service. ## Supported APIs - [Models]( - [Completions]( - [Chat Completions]( - [Edits]( - [Embeddings]( - [Audio]( - [Files]( - [Fine-tuning]( - [Images]( - [Moderations]( - [Assistants]( #### Deprecated by OpenAI - [Engines]( - [Legacy Fine-Tunes]( ## Importing ### Gradle `implementation 'com.theokanning.openai-gpt3-java::'` ### Maven ```xml com.theokanning.openai-gpt3-java {api|client|service} version ``` ## Usage ### Data classes only If you want to make your own client, just import the POJOs from the `api` module. Your client will need to use snake case to work with the OpenAI API. ### Retrofit client If you're using retrofit, you can import the `client` module and use the [OpenAiApi](client/src/main/java/com/theokanning/openai/OpenAiApi.java). You'll have to add your auth token as a header (see [AuthenticationInterceptor](client/src/main/java/com/theokanning/openai/AuthenticationInterceptor.java)) and set your converter factory to use snake case and only include non-null fields. ### OpenAiService If you're looking for the fastest solution, import the `service` module and use [OpenAiService](service/src/main/java/com/theokanning/openai/service/OpenAiService.java). > The OpenAiService in the client module is deprecated, please switch to the new version in the service module. ```java OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(""your_token""); CompletionRequest completionRequest = CompletionRequest.builder() .prompt(""Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me"") .model(""babbage-002"""") .echo(true) .build(); service.createCompletion(completionRequest).getChoices().forEach(System.out::println); ``` ### Customizing OpenAiService If you need to customize OpenAiService, create your own Retrofit client and pass it in to the constructor. For example, do the following to add request logging (after adding the logging gradle dependency): ```java ObjectMapper mapper = defaultObjectMapper(); OkHttpClient client = defaultClient(token, timeout) .newBuilder() .interceptor(HttpLoggingInterceptor()) .build(); Retrofit retrofit = defaultRetrofit(client, mapper); OpenAiApi api = retrofit.create(OpenAiApi.class); OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(api); ``` ### Adding a Proxy To use a proxy, modify the OkHttp client as shown below: ```java ObjectMapper mapper = defaultObjectMapper(); Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress(host, port)); OkHttpClient client = defaultClient(token, timeout) .newBuilder() .proxy(proxy) .build(); Retrofit retrofit = defaultRetrofit(client, mapper); OpenAiApi api = retrofit.create(OpenAiApi.class); OpenAiService service = new OpenAiService(api); ``` ### Functions You can create your functions and define their executors easily using the ChatFunction class, along with any of your custom classes that will serve to define their available parameters. You can also process the functions with ease, with the help of an executor called FunctionExecutor. First we declare our function parameters: ```java public class Weather { @JsonPropertyDescription(""City and state, for example: Len, Guanajuato"") public String location; @JsonPropertyDescription(""The temperature unit, can be 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'"") @JsonProperty(required = true) public WeatherUnit unit; } public enum WeatherUnit { CELSIUS, FAHRENHEIT; } public static class WeatherResponse { public String location; public WeatherUnit unit; public int temperature; public String description; // constructor } ``` Next, we declare the function itself and associate it with an executor, in this example we will fake a response from some API: ```java ChatFunction.builder() .name(""get_weather"") .description(""Get the current weather of a location"") .executor(Weather.class, w -> new WeatherResponse(w.location, w.unit, new Random().nextInt(50), ""sunny"")) .build() ``` Then, we employ the FunctionExecutor object from the 'service' module to assist with execution and transformation into an object that is ready for the conversation: ```java List functionList = // list with functions FunctionExecutor functionExecutor = new FunctionExecutor(functionList); List messages = new ArrayList<>(); ChatMessage userMessage = new ChatMessage(ChatMessageRole.USER.value(), ""Tell me the weather in Barcelona.""); messages.add(userMessage); ChatCompletionRequest chatCompletionRequest = ChatCompletionRequest .builder() .model(""gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"") .messages(messages) .functions(functionExecutor.getFunctions()) .functionCall(new ChatCompletionRequestFunctionCall(""auto"")) .maxTokens(256) .build(); ChatMessage responseMessage = service.createChatCompletion(chatCompletionRequest).getChoices().get(0).getMessage(); ChatFunctionCall functionCall = responseMessage.getFunctionCall(); // might be null, but in this case it is certainly a call to our 'get_weather' function. ChatMessage functionResponseMessage = functionExecutor.executeAndConvertToMessageHandlingExceptions(functionCall); messages.add(response); ``` > **Note:** The `FunctionExecutor` class is part of the 'service' module. You can also create your own function executor. The return object of `ChatFunctionCall.getArguments()` is a JsonNode for simplicity and should be able to help you with that. For a more in-depth look, refer to a conversational example that employs functions in: [OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java). Or for an example using functions and stream: [OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java) ### Streaming thread shutdown If you want to shut down your process immediately after streaming responses, call `OpenAiService.shutdownExecutor()`. This is not necessary for non-streaming calls. ## Running the example project All the [example](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiExample.java) project requires is your OpenAI api token ```bash export OPENAI_TOKEN=""sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"" ``` You can try all the capabilities of this project using: ```bash ./gradlew runExampleOne ``` And you can also try the new capability of using functions: ```bash ./gradlew runExampleTwo ``` Or functions with 'stream' mode enabled: ```bash ./gradlew runExampleThree ``` ## FAQ ### Does this support GPT-4? Yes! GPT-4 uses the ChatCompletion Api, and you can see the latest model options [here]( GPT-4 is currently in a limited beta (as of 4/1/23), so make sure you have access before trying to use it. ### Does this support functions? Absolutely! It is very easy to use your own functions without worrying about doing the dirty work. As mentioned above, you can refer to [OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsExample.java) or [OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java](example/src/main/java/example/OpenAiApiFunctionsWithStreamExample.java) projects for an example. ### Why am I getting connection timeouts? Make sure that OpenAI is available in your country. ### Why doesn't OpenAiService support x configuration option? Many projects use OpenAiService, and in order to support them best I've kept it extremely simple. You can create your own OpenAiApi instance to customize headers, timeouts, base urls etc. If you want features like retry logic and async calls, you'll have to make an `OpenAiApi` instance and call it directly instead of using `OpenAiService` ## Deprecated Endpoints OpenAI has deprecated engine-based endpoints in favor of model-based endpoints. For example, instead of using `v1/engines/{engine_id}/completions`, switch to `v1/completions` and specify the model in the `CompletionRequest`. The code includes upgrade instructions for all deprecated endpoints. I won't remove the old endpoints from this library until OpenAI shuts them down. ## License Published under the MIT License","1.1k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, enhancement, wontfix, question, invalid, help wanted, good first issue, duplicate, documentation, bug"
shardingsphere,apache/shardingsphere,19497,"['Java', 'ANTLR', 'FreeMarker']","['database', 'distributed-database', 'distributed-sql-database', 'distributed-transactions', 'sql']","## [Distributed SQL transaction & query engine for data sharding, scaling, encryption, and more - on any database.]( **Official Website:** [ []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( | **Stargazers Over Time** | **Contributors Over Time** | |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| | []( | []( | ### OVERVIEW Apache ShardingSphere is a distributed SQL transaction & query engine that allows for data sharding, scaling, encryption, and more - on any database. Our community's guiding development concept is Database Plus for creating a complete ecosystem that allows you to transform any database into a distributed database system. It focuses on repurposing existing databases, by placing a standardized upper layer above existing and fragmented databases, rather than creating a new database. The goal is to provide unified database services and minimize or eliminate the challenges caused by underlying databases' fragmentation. This results in applications only needing to communicate with a single standardized service. The concepts at the core of the project are `Connect`, `Enhance` and `Pluggable`. - `Connect:` Flexible adaptation of database protocol, SQL dialect and database storage. It can quickly connect applications and heterogeneous databases. - `Enhance:` Capture database access entry to provide additional features transparently, such as: redirect (sharding, readwrite-splitting and shadow), transform (data encrypt and mask), authentication (security, audit and authority), governance (circuit breaker and access limitation and analyze, QoS and observability). - `Pluggable:` Leveraging the micro kernel and 3 layers pluggable mode, features and database ecosystem can be embedded flexibly. Developers can customize their ShardingSphere just like building with LEGO blocks. ShardingSphere became an [Apache]( Top-Level Project on April 16, 2020. So far, ShardingSphere has been used by over [10,000 projects on GitHub]( ### DOCUMENTATION []( []( For full documentation & more details, visit: [Docs]( ### CONTRIBUTION For guides on how to get started and setup your environment, contributor & committer guides, visit: [Contribution Guidelines]( ### Team We deeply appreciate [community contributors]( for their dedication to Apache ShardingSphere. ## ### COMMUNITY & SUPPORT :link: [Mailing List]( Best for: Apache community updates, releases, changes. :link: [GitHub Issues]( Best for: larger systemic questions/bug reports or anything development related. :link: [GitHub Discussions]( Best for: technical questions & support, requesting new features, proposing new features. :link: [Slack channel]( Best for: instant communications and online meetings, sharing your applications. :link: [Twitter]( Best for: keeping up to date on everything ShardingSphere. :link: [LinkedIn]( Best for: professional networking and career development with other ShardingSphere contributors. ## ### STATUS :white_check_mark: Version 5.5.0: released :tada: For the release notes, follow this link to the relevant [GitHub page]( :soon: Version 5.5.1 We are currently working towards our 5.5.1 milestone.

flink-cdc,apache/flink-cdc,5360,"['Java', 'JavaScript', 'Shell']","['change-data-capture', 'cdc', 'batch', 'data-integration', 'data-pipeline']","Flink CDC is a distributed data integration tool for real time data and batch data. Flink CDC brings the simplicity and elegance of data integration via YAML to describe the data movement and transformation in a [Data Pipeline](docs/content/docs/core-concept/data-pipeline.md). The Flink CDC prioritizes efficient end-to-end data integration and offers enhanced functionalities such as full database synchronization, sharding table synchronization, schema evolution and data transformation. ### Getting Started 1. Prepare a [Apache Flink]( cluster and set up `FLINK_HOME` environment variable. 2. [Download]( Flink CDC tar, unzip it and put jars of pipeline connector to Flink `lib` directory. 3. Create a **YAML** file to describe the data source and data sink, the following example synchronizes all tables under MySQL app_db database to Doris : ```yaml source: type: mysql name: MySQL Source hostname: 127.0.0.1 port: 3306 username: admin password: pass tables: adb.\.* server-id: 5401-5404 sink: type: doris name: Doris Sink fenodes: 127.0.0.1:8030 username: root password: pass pipeline: name: MySQL to Doris Pipeline parallelism: 4 ``` 4.

Iris was created to fill a void that I saw in the Minecraft customization and graphical enhancement community: the lack of an open-source shaders mod that would let me load my favorite shader packs on modern versions of the game, while retaining performance and compatibility with modpacks. OptiFine, the current dominant mod for loading shader packs, has restrictive licensing that firmly stands in the way of any sort of tinkering, and is fairly notorious for having compatibility issues with the mods that I like. It's also mutually incompatible with Sodium, the best rendering optimization mod in existence by a large margin. ShadersMod was never updated past 1.12, and it lacks support for many of the many modern popular shaderpacks. So I created Iris, to try and solve these issues, and also address many other longstanding issues with shader packs. I first and foremost develop Iris to meet my own needs of a performance-oriented shaders mod with good compatibility and potential for tinkering. Iris when paired with Sodium delivers great performance on my machine, finally making it fully possible for me to actually play with shaders instead of just periodically switching them on to take pretty screenshots, then switching them off once I get tired of frame drops. Of course, as it turns out, I'm far from the only person who benefits from the development of Iris, which is why I've decided to release it to the public as an open-source mod. Canvas is another shaders mod that has already gained some traction. Its big downside for me, however, is the fact that it doesn't support the existing popular OptiFine shaderpacks that I want to use. This is because it uses a new format for shader packs that isn't compatible with the existing format, in order to achieve many of its goals for better mod integration with shaders. And while Canvas now has a few nice shaders like Lumi Lights, I still want to have the option of using existing shader packs that were designed for OptiFine. Shader packs just aren't interchangeable, just like how you cannot hand a copy of *The Last Supper* to someone who wants a copy of the *Mona Lisa*. They're both great pieces of art, but you absolutely cannot just swap one out for the other. That being said, if you're a fan of the shader packs available for Canvas, then great! Canvas and Iris are both perfectly fine ways to enjoy shaders with Minecraft. ## Goals These are the goals of Iris. Iris hasn't fully achieved all these goals, however we are getting close. * **Performance.** Iris should fully utilize your graphics card when paired with optimization mods like Sodium. * **Correctness.** Iris should try to be as issueless as possible in its implementation. * **Mod compatibility.** Iris should make a best effort to be compatible with modded environments. * **Backwards compatibility.** All existing ShadersMod / OptiFine shader packs should just work on Iris, without any modifications required. * **Features for shader pack developers.** Once Iris has full support for existing features of the shader pipeline and is reasonably bug free, I wish to expand the horizons of what's possible to do with Minecraft shader packs through the addition of new features to the shader pipeline. Unlimited color buffers, direct voxel data access, and fancy debug HUDs are some examples of features that I'd like to add in the future. * **A well-organized codebase.** I'd like for working with Iris code to be a pleasant experience overall. ## What's the current state of development? Iris has public releases for 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.3, and 1.19.4 that work with the official releases of Sodium. Iris is generally usable on most shader packs, and most shader packs are being designed with Iris support in mind. However, Iris is still not complete software. Performance can be improved, and more features are being added for shader developers. There are also some minor missing features from OptiFine that make the implementation incomplete. ## How can I help? * The Iris Discord server is looking for people willing to provide support and moderate the server! Go to #applications on our server if you'd like to apply. * Code review on open PRs is appreciated! This helps get important issues with PRs resolved before I give them a look. * Code contributions through PRs are also welcome! If you're working on a large / significant feature it's usually a good idea to talk about your plans beforehand, to make sure that work isn't wasted. ## But where's the Forge version? Iris doesn't support Forge. This is for a few reasons: * My time is limited, and properly supporting all the mods available for Forge (as well as Forge itself) is a huge amount of work. When people ask for Forge support, they aren't asking just for Iris to run on Forge, they are also asking for it to be compatible out of the box with their kitchen sink modpack that contains over 300 mods. As a result, properly supporting Forge would require me to divert large amounts of precious time into fixing tedious compatibility issues and bugs, time that could instead be spent making the Fabric version of Iris better. * The Forge toolchain isn't really designed to play nice with mods like Iris that need to make many patches to the game code. It's possible, but Fabric & Quilt are just *better* for mods like Iris. It's no coincidence that the emergence of Fabric and the initial emergence of OptiFine replacements happened at around the same time. * Sodium, which Iris depends on to achieve its great performance, has no official Forge version. It's a long story, but in short: the lead developers of Forge were incredibly hostile to JellySquid when she developed for Forge, and since then have made no credible attempts to repair relations or even admit wrongdoing. Some users have already ported Iris to Forge, however these ports generally come with mod compatibility issues and outdated updates. The license of Iris does permit others to legally port Iris to Forge, and we are not strictly opposed to the existence of an Iris Forge port created by others. However, what we are opposed to is someone doing a bare-minimum port of Iris to Forge, releasing it to the public, and then abandoning it or poorly maintaining it while compatibility issues and bug reports accumulate. When that happens, not only does that hurt the reputation of Iris, but we also ultimately get flooded by users wanting support with a low-effort Forge port that we didn't even make. So, if you want to distribute a Forge port of Iris, we'd prefer if you let us know. Please don't just name your port ""Iris Forge,"" ""Iris for Forge,"" or ""Iris Forge Port"" either. Be original, and don't just hijack our name, unless we've given you permission to use one of those kinds of names. If a well-qualified group of people willing to maintain a Forge port of Iris does appear, then a name like ""Iris Forge"" might be appropriate - otherwise, it probably isn't appropriate. ## Credits * **TheOnlyThing and Vaerian**, for creating the excellent logo * **Mumfrey**, for creating the Mixin bytecode patching system used by Iris and Sodium internally * **The Fabric and Quilt projects**, for enabling the existence of mods like Iris that make many patches to the game * **JellySquid**, for creating Sodium, the best rendering optimization mod for Minecraft that currently exists, and for making it open-source * **All past, present, and future contributors to Iris**, for helping the project move along * **Dr. Rubisco**, for maintaining the website * **The Iris support and moderation team**, for handling user support requests and allowing me to focus on developing Iris * **daxnitro, karyonix, and sp614x**, for creating and maintaining the current shaders mods ## License All code in this (Iris) repository is completely free and open source, and you are free to read, distribute, and modify the code as long as you abide by the (fairly reasonable) terms of the [GNU LGPLv3 license]( glsl-transformer is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.

Built by developers, for developers. []( []( []( []( DOCS QUICK START COMMUNITY DISCORD AWS Marketplace ProductHunt #### UI for Apache Kafka is a free, open-source web UI to monitor and manage Apache Kafka clusters. UI for Apache Kafka is a simple tool that makes your data flows observable, helps find and troubleshoot issues faster and deliver optimal performance. Its lightweight dashboard makes it easy to track key metrics of your Kafka clusters - Brokers, Topics, Partitions, Production, and Consumption. ### DISCLAIMER UI for Apache Kafka is a free tool built and supported by the open-source community. Curated by Provectus, it will remain free and open-source, without any paid features or subscription plans to be added in the future. Looking for the help of Kafka experts? Provectus can help you design, build, deploy, and manage Apache Kafka clusters and streaming applications. Discover [Professional Services for Apache Kafka]( to unlock the full potential of Kafka in your enterprise! Set up UI for Apache Kafka with just a couple of easy commands to visualize your Kafka data in a comprehensible way. You can run the tool locally or in the cloud. # Features * **Multi-Cluster Management** monitor and manage all your clusters in one place * **Performance Monitoring with Metrics Dashboard** track key Kafka metrics with a lightweight dashboard * **View Kafka Brokers** view topic and partition assignments, controller status * **View Kafka Topics** view partition count, replication status, and custom configuration * **View Consumer Groups** view per-partition parked offsets, combined and per-partition lag * **Browse Messages** browse messages with JSON, plain text, and Avro encoding * **Dynamic Topic Configuration** create and configure new topics with dynamic configuration * **Configurable Authentification** [secure]( your installation with optional Github/Gitlab/Google OAuth 2.0 * **Custom serialization/deserialization plugins** - [use]( a ready-to-go serde for your data like AWS Glue or Smile, or code your own! * **Role based access control** - [manage permissions]( to access the UI with granular precision * **Data masking** - [obfuscate]( sensitive data in topic messages # The Interface UI for Apache Kafka wraps major functions of Apache Kafka with an intuitive user interface. ## Topics UI for Apache Kafka makes it easy for you to create topics in your browser by several clicks, pasting your own parameters, and viewing topics in the list. It's possible to jump from connectors view to corresponding topics and from a topic to consumers (back and forth) for more convenient navigation. connectors, overview topic settings. ### Messages Let's say we want to produce messages for our topic. With the UI for Apache Kafka we can send or write data/messages to the Kafka topics without effort by specifying parameters, and viewing messages in the list. ## Schema registry There are 3 supported types of schemas: Avro, JSON Schema, and Protobuf schemas. Before producing avro/protobuf encoded messages, you have to add a schema for the topic in Schema Registry. Now all these steps are easy to do with a few clicks in a user-friendly interface. # Getting Started To run UI for Apache Kafka, you can use either a pre-built Docker image or build it (or a jar file) yourself. ## Quick start (Demo run) ``` docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ENABLED=true provectuslabs/kafka-ui ``` Then access the web UI at [ The command is sufficient to try things out.

kafka,apache/kafka,27569,"['Java', 'Scala', 'Python']","['scala', 'kafka']","Apache Kafka ================= See our [web site]( for details on the project. You need to have [Java]( installed. We build and test Apache Kafka with Java 8, 11, 17 and 21. We set the `release` parameter in javac and scalac to `8` to ensure the generated binaries are compatible with Java 8 or higher (independently of the Java version used for compilation). Java 8 support project-wide has been deprecated since Apache Kafka 3.0, Java 11 support for the broker and tools has been deprecated since Apache Kafka 3.7 and removal of both is planned for Apache Kafka 4.0 ( see [KIP-750]( and [KIP-1013]( for more details). Scala 2.12 and 2.13 are supported and 2.13 is used by default. Scala 2.12 support has been deprecated since Apache Kafka 3.0 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0 (see [KIP-751]( for more details). See below for how to use a specific Scala version or all of the supported Scala versions. ### Build a jar and run it ### ./gradlew jar Follow instructions in ### Build source jar ### ./gradlew srcJar ### Build aggregated javadoc ### ./gradlew aggregatedJavadoc ### Build javadoc and scaladoc ### ./gradlew javadoc ./gradlew javadocJar # builds a javadoc jar for each module ./gradlew scaladoc ./gradlew scaladocJar # builds a scaladoc jar for each module ./gradlew docsJar # builds both (if applicable) javadoc and scaladoc jars for each module ### Run unit/integration tests ### ./gradlew test # runs both unit and integration tests ./gradlew unitTest ./gradlew integrationTest ### Force re-running tests without code change ### ./gradlew test --rerun ./gradlew unitTest --rerun ./gradlew integrationTest --rerun ### Running a particular unit/integration test ### ./gradlew clients:test --tests RequestResponseTest ### Repeatedly running a particular unit/integration test ### I=0; while ./gradlew clients:test --tests RequestResponseTest --rerun --fail-fast; do (( I=$I+1 )); echo ""Completed run: $I""; sleep 1; done ### Running a particular test method within a unit/integration test ### ./gradlew core:test --tests kafka.api.ProducerFailureHandlingTest.testCannotSendToInternalTopic ./gradlew clients:test --tests org.apache.kafka.clients.MetadataTest.testTimeToNextUpdate ### Running a particular unit/integration test with log4j output ### By default, there will be only small number of logs output while testing. You can adjust it by changing the `log4j.properties` file in the module's `src/test/resources` directory. For example, if you want to see more logs for clients project tests, you can modify [the line]( in `clients/src/test/resources/log4j.properties` to `log4j.logger.org.apache.kafka=INFO` and then run: ./gradlew cleanTest clients:test --tests NetworkClientTest And you should see `INFO` level logs in the file under the `clients/build/test-results/test` directory. ### Specifying test retries ### By default, each failed test is retried once up to a maximum of five retries per test run. Tests are retried at the end of the test task. Adjust these parameters in the following way: ./gradlew test -PmaxTestRetries=1 -PmaxTestRetryFailures=5 See [Test Retry Gradle Plugin]( for more details. ### Generating test coverage reports ### Generate coverage reports for the whole project: ./gradlew reportCoverage -PenableTestCoverage=true -Dorg.gradle.parallel=false Generate coverage for a single module, i.e.: ./gradlew clients:reportCoverage -PenableTestCoverage=true -Dorg.gradle.parallel=false ### Building a binary release gzipped tar ball ### ./gradlew clean releaseTarGz The release file can be found inside `./core/build/distributions/`. ### Building auto generated messages ### Sometimes it is only necessary to rebuild the RPC auto-generated message data when switching between branches, as they could fail due to code changes. You can just run: ./gradlew processMessages processTestMessages ### Running a Kafka broker in KRaft mode Using compiled files: KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID=""$(./bin/kafka-storage.sh random-uuid)"" ./bin/kafka-storage.sh format -t $KAFKA_CLUSTER_ID -c config/kraft/server.properties ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties Using docker image: docker run -p 9092:9092 apache/kafka:3.7.0 ### Running a Kafka broker in ZooKeeper mode Using compiled files: ./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties >Since ZooKeeper mode is already deprecated and planned to be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0, the docker image only supports running in KRaft mode ### Cleaning the build ### ./gradlew clean ### Running a task with one of the Scala versions available (2.12.x or 2.13.x) ### *Note that if building the jars with a version other than 2.13.x, you need to set the `SCALA_VERSION` variable or change it in `bin/kafka-run-class.sh` to run the quick start.* You can pass either the major version (eg 2.12) or the full version (eg 2.12.7): ./gradlew -PscalaVersion=2.12 jar ./gradlew -PscalaVersion=2.12 test ./gradlew -PscalaVersion=2.12 releaseTarGz ### Running a task with all the scala versions enabled by default ### Invoke the `gradlewAll` script followed by the task(s): ./gradlewAll test ./gradlewAll jar ./gradlewAll releaseTarGz ### Running a task for a specific project ### This is for `core`, `examples` and `clients` ./gradlew core:jar ./gradlew core:test Streams has multiple sub-projects, but you can run all the tests: ./gradlew :streams:testAll ### Listing all gradle tasks ### ./gradlew tasks ### Building IDE project #### *Note that this is not strictly necessary (IntelliJ IDEA has good built-in support for Gradle projects, for example).* ./gradlew eclipse ./gradlew idea The `eclipse` task has been configured to use `${project_dir}/build_eclipse` as Eclipse's build directory. Eclipse's default build directory (`${project_dir}/bin`) clashes with Kafka's scripts directory and we don't use Gradle's build directory to avoid known issues with this configuration. ### Publishing the jar for all versions of Scala and for all projects to maven ### The recommended command is: ./gradlewAll publish For backwards compatibility, the following also works: ./gradlewAll uploadArchives Please note for this to work you should create/update `${GRADLE_USER_HOME}/gradle.properties` (typically, `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`) and assign the following variables mavenUrl= mavenUsername= mavenPassword= signing.keyId= signing.password= signing.secretKeyRingFile= ### Publishing the streams quickstart archetype artifact to maven ### For the Streams archetype project, one cannot use gradle to upload to maven; instead the `mvn deploy` command needs to be called at the quickstart folder: cd streams/quickstart mvn deploy Please note for this to work you should create/update user maven settings (typically, `${USER_HOME}/.m2/settings.xml`) to assign the following variables ... ... apache.snapshots. ${maven_username} ${maven_password} apache.releases. ${maven_username} ${maven_password} ... ... ### Installing ALL the jars to the local Maven repository ### The recommended command to build for both Scala 2.12 and 2.13 is: ./gradlewAll publishToMavenLocal For backwards compatibility, the following also works: ./gradlewAll install ### Installing specific projects to the local Maven repository ### ./gradlew -PskipSigning=true :streams:publishToMavenLocal If needed, you can specify the Scala version with `-PscalaVersion=2.13`. ### Building the test jar ### ./gradlew testJar ### Running code quality checks ### There are two code quality analysis tools that we regularly run, spotbugs and checkstyle. #### Checkstyle #### Checkstyle enforces a consistent coding style in Kafka. You can run checkstyle using: ./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest The checkstyle warnings will be found in `reports/checkstyle/reports/main.html` and `reports/checkstyle/reports/test.html` files in the subproject build directories. They are also printed to the console. The build will fail if Checkstyle fails. #### Spotbugs #### Spotbugs uses static analysis to look for bugs in the code. You can run spotbugs using: ./gradlew spotbugsMain spotbugsTest -x test The spotbugs warnings will be found in `reports/spotbugs/main.html` and `reports/spotbugs/test.html` files in the subproject build directories. Use -PxmlSpotBugsReport=true to generate an XML report instead of an HTML one. ### JMH microbenchmarks ### We use [JMH]( to write microbenchmarks that produce reliable results in the JVM. See [jmh-benchmarks/README.md]( for details on how to run the microbenchmarks. ### Dependency Analysis ### The gradle [dependency debugging documentation]( mentions using the `dependencies` or `dependencyInsight` tasks to debug dependencies for the root project or individual subprojects. Alternatively, use the `allDeps` or `allDepInsight` tasks for recursively iterating through all subprojects: ./gradlew allDeps ./gradlew allDepInsight --configuration runtimeClasspath --dependency com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind These take the same arguments as the builtin variants. ### Determining if any dependencies could be updated ### ./gradlew dependencyUpdates ### Common build options ### The following options should be set with a `-P` switch, for example `./gradlew -PmaxParallelForks=1 test`. * `commitId`: sets the build commit ID as .git/HEAD might not be correct if there are local commits added for build purposes. * `mavenUrl`: sets the URL of the maven deployment repository (`file://path/to/repo` can be used to point to a local repository). * `maxParallelForks`: maximum number of test processes to start in parallel. Defaults to the number of processors available to the JVM. * `maxScalacThreads`: maximum number of worker threads for the scalac backend. Defaults to the lowest of `8` and the number of processors available to the JVM. The value must be between 1 and 16 (inclusive). * `ignoreFailures`: ignore test failures from junit * `showStandardStreams`: shows standard out and standard error of the test JVM(s) on the console. * `skipSigning`: skips...

The syntax is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Assertions and HTML reports are built-in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed. There's also a cross-platform [stand-alone executable](karate-netty#standalone-jar) for teams not comfortable with Java. You don't have to compile code. Just write tests in a **simple**, *readable* syntax - carefully designed for HTTP, JSON, GraphQL and XML. And you can mix API and [UI test-automation](karate-core) within the same test script. A [Java API](#java-api) also exists for those who prefer to programmatically integrate Karate's rich automation and data-assertion capabilities. ## Hello World ### For API Testing > If you are familiar with Cucumber / Gherkin, the [*big difference*](#cucumber-vs-karate) here is that you **don't** need to write extra ""glue"" code or Java ""step definitions"" ! It is worth pointing out that JSON is a 'first class citizen' of the syntax such that you can express payload and expected data without having to use double-quotes and without having to enclose JSON field names in quotes. There is no need to 'escape' characters like you would have had to in Java or other programming languages. And you don't need to create additional Java classes for any of the payloads that you need to work with. # Index Start Maven | Gradle | Quickstart | Standalone Executable | Naming Conventions | Script Structure Run JUnit 5 | Command Line | IDE Support | Tags / Grouping | Parallel Execution | Java API | jbang Report Configuration | Environment Switching | Reports | JUnit HTML Report | Dry Run | Report Verbosity | Logging | Log Masking Types JSON | XML | JavaScript Functions | Reading Files | Type / String Conversion | Floats and Integers | Embedded Expressions | JsonPath | XPath | Karate Expressions Variables def | text | table | yaml | csv | string | json | xml | xmlstring | bytes | copy Actions assert | print | replace | get | set | remove | configure | call | callonce | eval | listen | doc | read() | compareImage | karate JS API HTTP url | path | request | method | status | soap action | retry until Request param | header | cookie | form field | multipart file | multipart field | multipart entity | params | headers | cookies | form fields | multipart files | multipart fields Response response | responseBytes | responseStatus | responseHeaders | responseCookies | responseTime | responseType | requestTimeStamp Assert match == | match != | match contains | match contains only | match contains any | match contains deep | match contains only deep | match !contains | match each | match each contains deep | match header | Fuzzy Matching | Schema Validation | contains short-cuts Re-Use Calling Other *.feature Files | Data Driven Features | Calling JavaScript Functions | Calling Java Code | Commonly Needed Utilities | Data Driven Scenarios Advanced Polling | Conditional Logic | Before / After Hooks | JSON Transforms | Loops | HTTP Basic Auth | Header Manipulation | GraphQL | Websockets / Async | call vs read() More Test Doubles | Performance Testing | UI Testing | Desktop Automation | VS Code / Debug | Karate vs REST-assured | Karate vs Cucumber | Examples and Demos # Features * Java knowledge is not required and even non-programmers can write tests * Scripts are plain-text, require no compilation step or IDE, and teams can collaborate using Git / standard SCM * Based on the popular Cucumber / Gherkin standard - with [IDE support]( and syntax-coloring options * Elegant [DSL]( syntax 'natively' supports JSON and XML - including [JsonPath](#set) and [XPath](#xpath-functions) expressions * Eliminate the need for 'Java Beans' or 'helper code' to represent payloads and HTTP end-points, and [dramatically reduce the lines of code]( needed for a test * Ideal for testing the highly dynamic responses from [GraphQL]( API-s because of Karate's built-in [text-manipulation](#text) and [JsonPath]( capabilities * Tests are super-readable - as scenario data can be expressed in-line, in human-friendly [JSON](#json), [XML](#xml), Cucumber [Scenario](#the-cucumber-way) Outline [tables](#table), or a [payload builder](#set-multiple) approach [unique to Karate]( * Express expected results as readable, well-formed JSON or XML, and [assert in a single step](#match) that the entire response payload (no matter how complex or deeply nested) - is as expected * Comprehensive [assertion capabilities](#fuzzy-matching) - and failures clearly report which data element (and path) is not as expected, for easy troubleshooting of even large payloads * [Fully featured debugger]( that can step *backwards* and even [re-play a step while editing it]( - a *huge* time-saver * Simpler and more [powerful alternative]( to JSON-schema for [validating payload structure](#schema-validation) and format - that even supports [cross-field](#referring-to-the-json-root) / domain validation logic * Scripts can [call other scripts](#calling-other-feature-files) - which means that you can easily re-use and maintain authentication and 'set up' flows efficiently, across multiple tests * Embedded JavaScript engine that allows you to build a library of [re-usable functions](#calling-javascript-functions) that suit your specific environment or organization * Re-use of payload-data and user-defined functions across tests is [so easy](#reading-files) - that it becomes a natural habit for the test-developer * Built-in support for [switching configuration](#switching-the-environment) across different environments (e.g. dev, QA, pre-prod) * Support for [data-driven tests](#data-driven-tests) and being able to [tag or group](#tags) tests is built-in, no need to rely on an external framework * Native support for reading [YAML](#yaml) and even [CSV](#csv-files) files - and you can use them for data-driven tests * Standard Java / Maven project structure, and [seamless integration](#command-line) into CI / CD pipelines - and support for [JUnit 5](#junit-5) * Option to use as a light-weight [stand-alone executable]( - convenient for teams not comfortable with Java * Multi-threaded [parallel execution](#parallel-execution), which is a huge time-saver, especially for integration and end-to-end tests * Built-in [test-reports](#test-reports) compatible with Cucumber so that you have the option of using third-party (open-source) maven-plugins for even [better-looking reports](karate-demo#example-report) * Reports include HTTP request and response [logs *in-line*](#test-reports), which makes [troubleshooting]( and [debugging]( easier * Easily invoke JDK classes, Java libraries, or re-use custom Java code if needed, for [ultimate extensibility](#calling-java) * Simple plug-in system for [authentication](# and HTTP [header management](#configure-headers) that will handle any complex, real-world scenario * [Cross-browser Web UI automation](karate-core) so that you can test *all* layers of your application with the same framework * [experimental] [Android and iOS mobile support]( via [Appium]( * Visual Validation via the built-in [image comparison](#compare-image) capabilities * Cross platform [Desktop Automation](karate-robot) that can be [mixed into Web Automation flows]( if needed * Option to invoke via a [Java API](#java-api), which means that you can easily [mix Karate into Java projects or legacy UI-automation suites]( * [Save significant effort]( by re-using Karate test-suites as [Gatling performance tests](karate-gatling) that *deeply* assert that server responses are accurate under load * Gatling integration can hook into [*any* custom Java code]( - which means that you can perf-test even non-HTTP protocols such as [gRPC]( * [API mocks](karate-netty) or test-doubles that even [maintain CRUD 'state']( across multiple calls - enabling TDD for micro-services and [Consumer Driven Contracts]( * [Async](#async) support that allows you to seamlessly integrate the handling of custom events or listening to message-queues * Built-in [HTML templating]( so that you can extend your test-reports into readable specifications * Comprehensive support for different flavors of HTTP calls: * [SOAP](#soap-action) / XML requests * HTTPS / [SSL](#configure) - without needing certificates, key-stores or trust-stores * HTTP [proxy server](#configure) support * URL-encoded [HTML-form](#form-field) data * [Multi-part](#multipart-field) file-upload - including `multipart/mixed` and `multipart/related` * Browser-like [cookie](#cookie) handling * Full control over HTTP [headers](#header), [path](#path) and query [parameters](#param) * [Re-try](#retry-until) until condition * [Websocket]( [support](#async) ## Real World Examples A set of real-life examples can be found here: [Karate Demos](karate-demo) ## Comparison with REST-assured For teams familiar with or currently using [REST-assured]( this detailed comparison of [Karate vs REST-assured]( -

selenium,SeleniumHQ/selenium,29491,"['Java', 'C#', 'C++']","['selenium', 'webdriver', 'java', 'ruby', 'python']","# Selenium []( Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically provides an infrastructure for the [W3C WebDriver specification]( a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers. The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who've generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep. Selenium's source code is made available under the [Apache 2.0 license]( This README is for developers interested in contributing to the project. For people looking to get started using Selenium, please check out our [User Manual]( for detailed examples and descriptions, and if you get stuck, there are several ways to [Get Help]( ## Contributing Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md]( before submitting your pull requests. ## Installing These are the requirements to create your own local dev environment to contribute to Selenium. ### All Platforms * [Bazelisk]( a Bazel wrapper that automatically downloads the version of Bazel specified in `.bazelversion` file and transparently passes through all command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary. * Java JDK version 17 or greater (e.g., [Java 17 Temurin]( * Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to location of Java executable (the JDK not the JRE) * To test this, try running the command `javac`. This command won't exist if you only have the JRE installed. If you're met with a list of command-line options, you're referencing the JDK properly. ### MacOS * Xcode including the command-line tools. Install the latest version using: `xcode-select --install` * Rosetta for Apple Silicon Macs. Add `build --host_platform=//:rosetta` to the `.bazelrc.local` file. We are working to make sure this isn't required in the long run. ### Windows Several years ago [Jim Evans]( published a great article on [Setting Up a Windows Development Environment for the Selenium .NET Language Bindings]( This article is out of date, but it includes more detailed descriptions and screenshots that some people might find useful. Click to see Current Windows Setup Requirements #### Option 1: Automatic Installation from Scratch This script will ensure a complete ready to execute developer environment. (nothing is installed or set that is already present unless otherwise prompted) 1. Open Powershell as an Administrator 2. Execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force` to allow running the script in the process 3. Navigate to the directory you want to clone Selenium in, or the parent directory of an already cloned Selenium repo 4. Download and execute this script in the powershell terminal: [scripts/dev-environment-setup.ps1]` #### Option 2: Manual Installation 1. Allow running scripts in Selenium in general: ``` Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned ``` 2. Enable Developer Mode: ``` reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock"" /t REG_DWORD /f /v ""AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense"" /d ""1"" ``` 3. Install [MSYS2]( which is an alternative shell environment that provides Unix-like commands * Add bin directory to `PATH` environment variable (e.g., `""C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin""`) * Add `bash.exe` location as the `BAZEL_SH` environment variable (e.g., `""C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe""`) 4. Install the latest version of [Visual Studio Community]( * Use the visual studio installer to modify and add the ""Desktop development with C++"" Workload * Add Visual C++ build tools installation directory location to `BAZEL_VC` environment variable (e.g. `""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC""`) * Add Visual C++ Build tools version to `BAZEL_VC_FULL_VERSION` environment variable (this can be discovered from the directory name in `""$BAZEL_VC\Tools\MSVC\""`) 5. Add support for long file names (bazel has a lot of nested directories that can exceed default limits in Windows) * Enable Long Paths support with these 2 registry commands: ```shell reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor"" /t REG_DWORD /f /v ""DisableUNCCheck"" /d ""1"" reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem"" /t REG_DWORD /f /v ""LongPathsEnabled"" /d ""1"" ``` * Allow Bazel to create short name versions of long file paths: `fsutil 8dot3name set 0` * Set bazel output to `C:/tmp` instead of nested inside project directory: * Create a file `selenium/.bazelrc.windows.local` * Add ""startup --output_user_root=C:/tmp"" to the file ### Alternative Dev Environments If you want to contribute to the project, but do not want to set up your own local dev environment, there are two alternatives available. #### Using GitPod Rather than creating your own local dev environment, GitPod provides a ready to use environment for you. []( #### Using Dev Container As an alternative you can build a [Dev Container]( - basically a docker container - suitable for building and testing Selenium using the devcontainer.json in the [.devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) directory. Supporting IDEs like VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA should point you to how such a container can be created. #### Using Docker Image You can also build a Docker image suitable for building and testing Selenium using the Dockerfile in the [dev image](scripts/dev-image/Dockerfile) directory. ## Building Selenium is built using a common build tool called [Bazel]( to allow us to easily manage dependency downloads, generate required binaries, build and release packages, and execute tests; all in a fast, efficient manner. For a more detailed discussion, read Simon Stewart's article on [Building Selenium]( Often we wrap Bazel commands with our custom [Rake]( wrapper. These are run with the `./go` command. The common Bazel commands are: * `bazel build` evaluates dependencies, compiles source files and generates output files for the specified target. It's used to create executable binaries, libraries, or other artifacts. * `bazel run` builds the target and then executes it. It's typically used for targets that produce executable binaries. * `bazel test` builds and runs the target in a context with additional testing functionality * `bazel query` identifies available targets for the provided path. Each module that can be built is defined in a `BUILD.bazel` file. To execute the module you refer to it starting with a `//`, then include the relative path to the file that defines it, then `:`, then the name of the target. For example, the target to build the Grid is named `executable-grid` and it is defined in the `'selenium/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/BAZEL.build'` file. So to build the grid you would run: `bazel build //java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid:executable-grid`. The Bazel documentation has a [handy guide]( for various shortcuts and all the ways to build multiple targets, which Selenium makes frequent use of. To build everything for a given language: ```shell bazel build ///... ``` To build just the grid there is an alias name to use (the log will show where the output jar is located): ```sh bazel build grid ``` To make things more simple, building each of the bindings is available with this `./go` command ```shell ./go :build ``` ## Developing ### Java #### IntelliJ Most of the team uses Intellij for their day-to-day editing. If you're working in IntelliJ, then we highly recommend installing the [Bazel IJ plugin]( which is documented on [its own site]( To use Selenium with the IntelliJ Bazel plugin, import the repository as a Bazel project, and select the project view file from the [scripts](scripts) directory. `ij.bazelproject` for Mac/Linux and `ij-win.bazelproject` for Windows. #### Linting We also use Google Java Format for linting, so using the Google Java Formatter Plugin is useful; there are a few steps to get it working, so read their [configuration documentation]( There is also an auto-formatting script that can be run: `./scripts/format.sh` #### Local Installation While Selenium is not built with Maven, you can build and install the Selenium pieces for Maven to use locally by deploying to your local maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`), using: ```shell ./go java:install ``` #### Updating Dependencies Dependencies are defined in the file [maven_deps.bzl]( To automatically update and pin new dependencies, run: ```shell ./go java:update ``` ### Python You can run Python code locally by updating generated files in the python directory using: ```shell ./go py:update ``` To install Selenium locally based on a specific commit, you can use: ```shell ./go py:install ``` ### Ruby Instead of using `irb`, you can create an interactive REPL with all gems loaded using: `bazel run //rb:console` If you want to debug code, you can do it via [`debug`]( gem: 1. Add `binding.break` to the code where you want the debugger to start. 2. Run tests with `ruby_debug` configuration: `bazel test --config ruby_debug `. 3. When debugger starts, run the following in a separate terminal to connect to debugger: ```sh bazel-selenium/external/bundle/bin/rdbg -A ``` If you want to use [RubyMine]( for development, you can configure it use Bazel artifacts: 1. Open `rb/` as a main project directory. 2. Run `bundle exec rake update` as necessary to create up-to-date artifacts. If this does not work, run `./go rb:update` from the `selenium` (parent) directory. 3. In Settings / Languages & Frameworks / Ruby SDK and Gems add new Interpreter pointing to `../bazel-selenium/external/rules_ruby_dist/dist/bin/ruby`. 4. You should now be able to run and debug any spec. It uses Chrome by default, but you can alter it using environment variables secified in [Ruby Testing](#ruby-2) section below. ### Rust To keep `Carbo.Bazel.lock` synchronized with `Cargo.lock`, run: ```shell CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=true bazel sync --only=crates ``` ## Testing There are a number of bazel configurations specific for testing. ### Common Options Examples Here are examples of arguments we make use of in testing the Selenium code: * `...

This project contains several sub-projects: * __wallet__: The Android app itself. This is probably what you're searching for. * __market__: App description and promo material for the Google Play app store. ### PREREQUISITES FOR BUILDING You'll need git, a Java 11 SDK and Gradle between 4.4 and 6.9.x for this. We'll assume Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) for the package installs, which comes with OpenJDK 11 and Gradle 4.4.1 out of the box. # first time only sudo apt install git gradle openjdk-11-jdk Create a directory for the Android SDK (e.g. `android-sdk`) and point the `ANDROID_HOME` variable to it. Download the [Android SDK Tools]( and unpack it to `$ANDROID_HOME/`. Finally, the last preparative step is acquiring the source code. Again in your workspace, use: # first time only git clone -b main bitcoin-wallet cd bitcoin-wallet ### BUILDING You can build all sub-projects in all flavors at once using Gradle: # each time gradle clean build For details about building the wallet see the [specific README](wallet/README.md). ### REPRODUCIBLE BUILD Alternatively, you can build using buildah: # each time buildah build --cap-add sys_admin --device /dev/fuse --file build.Containerfile --output build/ . Access to FUSE and the SYS_ADMIN capability are needed for mounting disorderfs in order to sort the directory entries of the project folder.

DependencyCheck,jeremylong/DependencyCheck,5946,"['Java', 'JavaScript', 'CMake']","['security-audit', 'build-tool', 'maven-plugin', 'jenkins-plugin', 'gradle-plugin']","[]( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( # Dependency-Check Dependency-Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project's dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries. Documentation and links to production binary releases can be found on the [github pages]( Additionally, more information about the architecture and ways to extend dependency-check can be found on the [wiki]. ## 9.0.0 Upgrade Notice **Upgrading to 9.0.0 or later is mandatory**; previous versions of dependency-check utilize the NVD data feeds which will be deprecated on Dec 15th, 2023. Versions earlier then 9.0.0 are no longer supported and could fail to work after Dec 15th, 2023. ### NVD API Key Highly Recommended With 9.0.0 dependency-check has moved from using the NVD data-feed to the NVD API. Users of dependency-check are **highly** encouraged to obtain an NVD API Key; see Without an NVD API Key dependency-check's updates will be **extremely slow**. Please see the documentation for the cli, maven, gradle, or ant integrations on how to set the NVD API key. #### The NVD API Key, CI, and Rate Limiting The NVD API has enforced rate limits. If you are using a single API KEY and multiple builds occur you could hit the rate limit and receive 403 errors. In a CI environment one must use a caching strategy. ### Breaking Changes 9.0.0 contains breaking changes which requires updates to the database. If using an externally hosted database the schema will need to be updated. When using the embedded H2 database, the schema should be upgraded automatically. However, if issues arise you may need to purge the database: - gradle: `./gradlew dependencyCheckPurge` - maven: `mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:9.0.0:purge` - cli: `dependency-check.sh --purge` #### Gradle build Environment With 9.0.0 users may encounter issues with `NoSuchMethodError` exceptions due to dependency resolution. If you encounter this issue you will need to pin some of the transitive dependencies of dependency-check to specific versions. For example: /buildSrc/build.gradle ```groovy dependencies { constraints { // org.owasp.dependencycheck needs at least this version of jackson. Other plugins pull in older versions.. add(""implementation"", ""com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom:2.16.1"") // org.owasp.dependencycheck needs these versions. Other plugins pull in older versions.. add(""implementation"", ""org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.14.0"") add(""implementation"", ""org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.11.0"") } } ``` ## Requirements ### Java Version Minimum Java Version: Java 8 update 251 While dependency-check 9.0.0 and higher will still run on Java 8 - the update version must be higher then 251. ### Internet Access OWASP dependency-check requires access to several externally hosted resources. For more information see [Internet Access Required]( ### Build Tools In order to analyze some technology stacks dependency-check may require other development tools to be installed. Some of the analysis listed below may be experimental and require the experimental analyzers to be enabled. 1. To analyze .NET Assemblies the dotnet 6 run time or SDK must be installed. - Assemblies targeting other run times can be analyzed - but 6 is required to run the analysis. 2. If analyzing GoLang projects `go` must be installed. 3. The analysis of `Elixir` projects requires `mix_audit`. 4. The analysis of `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` projects requires `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn` to be installed. - The analysis performed utilize the respective `audit` feature of each. 5. The analysis of Ruby is a wrapper around `bundle-audit`, which must be installed. ## Current Releases ### Jenkins Plugin For instructions on the use of the Jenkins plugin please see the [OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin page]( ### Command Line More detailed instructions can be found on the [dependency-check github pages]( The latest CLI can be downloaded from github in the [releases section]( Downloading the latest release: ``` $ VERSION=$(curl -s $ curl -Ls "" --output dependency-check.zip ``` On *nix ``` $ ./bin/dependency-check.sh -h $ ./bin/dependency-check.sh --out . --scan [path to jar files to be scanned] ``` On Windows ``` > .\bin\dependency-check.bat -h > .\bin\dependency-check.bat --out . --scan [path to jar files to be scanned] ``` On Mac with [Homebrew]( Note - homebrew users upgrading from 5.x to 6.0.0 will need to run `dependency-check.sh --purge`. ``` $ brew update && brew install dependency-check $ dependency-check -h $ dependency-check --out . --scan [path to jar files to be scanned] ``` ### Maven Plugin More detailed instructions can be found on the [dependency-check-maven github pages]( By default, the plugin is tied to the `verify` phase (i.e. `mvn verify`). Alternatively, one can directly invoke the plugin via `mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check`. The dependency-check plugin can be configured using the following: ```xml ... org.owasp dependency-check-maven check ... ... ... ``` ### Gradle Plugin For instructions on the use of the Gradle Plugin, please see the [dependency-check-gradle github page]( ### Ant Task For instructions on the use of the Ant Task, please see the [dependency-check-ant github page]( ## Development Prerequisites For installation to pass, you must have the following components installed: * Java: `java -version` 1.8 * Maven: `mvn -version` 3.5.0 and higher Tests cases require: * dotnet core version 6.0 * Go: `go version` 1.12 and higher * Ruby [bundler-audit]( * [Yarn]( * [pnpm]( ## Development Usage The following instructions outline how to compile and use the current snapshot. While every intention is to maintain a stable snapshot it is recommended that the release versions listed above be used. The repository has some large files due to test resources. The team has tried to clean up the history as much as possible. However, it is recommended that you perform a shallow clone to save yourself time: ```bash git clone --depth 1 ``` On *nix ``` $ mvn -s settings.xml install $ ./cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.sh -h $ ./cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.sh --out . --scan ./src/test/resources ``` On Windows ``` > mvn -s settings.xml install > .\cli\target\release\bin\dependency-check.bat -h > .\cli\target\release\bin\dependency-check.bat --out . --scan ./src/test/resources ``` Then load the resulting 'dependency-check-report.html' into your favorite browser. #### Building without running tests To speed up your turnaround cycle times, you can also compile without running the tests each time: `mvn -s settings.xml install -DskipTests=true` Please remember to at least run the tests once before opening the PR. :) ### IntelliJ Idea To be able to debug your tests in IntelliJ Idea, you can introduce a maven configuration that executes your test and enables debugging with breakpoints etc. Basically, you do whats described in and set the `forkCount` to 0, otherwise debugging wont work. Step by step: - `Run -> Edit Configurations` - `+ (Add new configuration) -> Maven` - Give the Configuration a name, e.g. `Run tests` - Choose working directory, e.g. `core` - In `command line`, enter `-DforkCount=0 -f pom.xml -s ../settings.xml test` - Press `OK` - `Run -> Debug`, then choose the newly created run configuration IntelliJ will now execute the test run for the `core` subproject with enabled debugging. Breakpoints set anywhere in code should work. #### Only test one function or one class If you would like to speed up your turnaround cycle times, you can also just test one function or one test class. This works by adding `-Dtest=MyTestClass` or `-Dtest=MyTestClass#myTestFunction` to the run configuration. The complete command line in the run configuration then would be: `-Dtest=MyTestClass#myTestFunction -DforkCount=0 -f pom.xml -s ../settings.xml test` ### Docker In the following example it is assumed that the source to be checked is in the current working directory and the reports will be written to `$(pwd)/odc-reports`. Persistent data and cache directories are used, allowing you to destroy the container after running. For Linux: ```sh #!/bin/sh DC_VERSION=""latest"" DC_DIRECTORY=$HOME/OWASP-Dependency-Check DC_PROJECT=""dependency-check scan: $(pwd)"" DATA_DIRECTORY=""$DC_DIRECTORY/data"" CACHE_DIRECTORY=""$DC_DIRECTORY/data/cache"" if [ ! -d ""$DATA_DIRECTORY"" ]; then echo ""Initially creating persistent directory: $DATA_DIRECTORY"" mkdir -p ""$DATA_DIRECTORY"" fi if [ ! -d ""$CACHE_DIRECTORY"" ]; then echo ""Initially creating persistent directory: $CACHE_DIRECTORY"" mkdir -p ""$CACHE_DIRECTORY"" fi # Make sure we are using the latest version docker pull owasp/dependency-check:$DC_VERSION docker run --rm \ -e user=$USER \ -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \ --volume $(pwd):/src:z \ --volume ""$DATA_DIRECTORY"":/usr/share/dependency-check/data:z \ --volume $(pwd)/odc-reports:/report:z \ owasp/dependency-check:$DC_VERSION \ --scan /src \ --format ""ALL"" \ --project ""$DC_PROJECT"" \ --out /report # Use suppression like this: (where /src == $pwd) # --suppression ""/src/security/dependency-check-suppression.xml"" ``` For Windows: ```bat @echo off set DC_VERSION=""latest"" set DC_DIRECTORY=%USERPROFILE%\OWASP-Dependency-Check SET DC_PROJECT=""dependency-check scan: %CD%"" set DATA_DIRECTORY=""%DC_DIRECTORY%\data"" set CACHE_DIRECTORY=""%DC_DIRECTORY%\data\cache"" IF NOT EXIST %DATA_DIRECTORY% ( echo Initially creating persistent directory: %DATA_DIRECTORY% mkdir %DATA_DIRECTORY% ) IF NOT EXIST %CACHE_DIRECTORY% ( echo Initially creating persistent directory: %CACHE_DIRECTORY% mkdir %CACHE_DIRECTORY% ) rem Make sure we are using the latest version docker pull owasp/dependency-check:%DC_VERSION% docker run --rm ^ --volume %CD%:/src ^ --volume %DATA_DIRECTORY%:/usr/share/dependency-check/data ^ --volume %CD%/odc-report...

""Whiteboards"" is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category. The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise.

Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method. async function getUser() { try { const response = await axios.get('/user?ID=12345'); console.log(response); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } } ``` > **Note**: `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet > Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution. Performing a `POST` request ```js axios.post('/user', { firstName: 'Fred', lastName: 'Flintstone' }) .then(function (response) { console.log(response); }) .catch(function (error) { console.log(error); }); ``` Performing multiple concurrent requests ```js function getUserAccount() { return axios.get('/user/12345'); } function getUserPermissions() { return axios.get('/user/12345/permissions'); } Promise.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()]) .then(function (results) { const acct = results[0]; const perm = results[1]; }); ``` ## axios API Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`. ##### axios(config) ```js // Send a POST request axios({ method: 'post', url: '/user/12345', data: { firstName: 'Fred', lastName: 'Flintstone' } }); ``` ```js // GET request for remote image in node.js axios({ method: 'get', url: ' responseType: 'stream' }) .then(function (response) { response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('ada_lovelace.jpg')) }); ``` ##### axios(url[, config]) ```js // Send a GET request (default method) axios('/user/12345'); ``` ### Request method aliases For convenience, aliases have been provided for all common request methods. ##### axios.request(config) ##### axios.get(url[, config]) ##### axios.delete(url[, config]) ##### axios.head(url[, config]) ##### axios.options(url[, config]) ##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]]) ##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]]) ##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]]) ###### NOTE When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don't need to be specified in config. ### Concurrency (Deprecated) Please use `Promise.all` to replace the below functions. Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests. axios.all(iterable) axios.spread(callback) ### Creating an instance You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config. ##### axios.create([config]) ```js const instance = axios.create({ baseURL: ' timeout: 1000, headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'} }); ``` ### Instance methods The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config. ##### axios#request(config) ##### axios#get(url[, config]) ##### axios#delete(url[, config]) ##### axios#head(url[, config]) ##### axios#options(url[, config]) ##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]]) ##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]]) ##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]]) ##### axios#getUri([config]) ## Request Config These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified. ```js { // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request url: '/user', // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request method: 'get', // default // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute. // It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs // to methods of that instance. baseURL: ' // `transformRequest` allows changes to the request data before it is sent to the server // This is only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', 'PATCH' and 'DELETE' // The last function in the array must return a string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer, // FormData or Stream // You may modify the headers object. transformRequest: [function (data, headers) { // Do whatever you want to transform the data return data; }], // `transformResponse` allows changes to the response data to be made before // it is passed to then/catch transformResponse: [function (data) { // Do whatever you want to transform the data return data; }], // `headers` are custom headers to be sent headers: {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'}, // `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request // Must be a plain object or a URLSearchParams object params: { ID: 12345 }, // `paramsSerializer` is an optional config that allows you to customize serializing `params`. paramsSerializer: { //Custom encoder function which sends key/value pairs in an iterative fashion. encode?: (param: string): string => { /* Do custom operations here and return transformed string */ }, // Custom serializer function for the entire parameter.

UglifyJS,mishoo/UglifyJS,12964,"['JavaScript', 'Shell', 'HTML']",[],"UglifyJS 3 ========== UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor and beautifier toolkit. #### Note: - `uglify-js` supports JavaScript and most language features in ECMAScript. - For more exotic parts of ECMAScript, process your source file with transpilers like [Babel]( before passing onto `uglify-js`. - `uglify-js@3` has a simplified [API](#api-reference) and [CLI](#command-line-usage) that is not backwards compatible with [`uglify-js@2`]( Install ------- First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js]( (You may need to restart your computer after this step). From NPM for use as a command line app: npm install uglify-js -g From NPM for programmatic use: npm install uglify-js # Command line usage uglifyjs [input files] [options] UglifyJS can take multiple input files. It's recommended that you pass the input files first, then pass the options. UglifyJS will parse input files in sequence and apply any compression options. The files are parsed in the same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly. If no input file is specified, UglifyJS will read from STDIN. If you wish to pass your options before the input files, separate the two with a double dash to prevent input files being used as option arguments: uglifyjs --compress --mangle -- input.js ### Command line options ``` -h, --help Print usage information. `--help options` for details on available options. -V, --version Print version number. -p, --parse Specify parser options: `acorn` Use Acorn for parsing. `bare_returns` Allow return outside of functions. Useful when minifying CommonJS modules and Userscripts that may be anonymous function wrapped (IIFE) by the .user.js engine `caller`. `spidermonkey` Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON). -c, --compress [options] Enable compressor/specify compressor options: `pure_funcs` List of functions that can be safely removed when their return values are not used. -m, --mangle [options] Mangle names/specify mangler options: `reserved` List of names that should not be mangled. --mangle-props [options] Mangle properties/specify mangler options: `builtins` Mangle property names that overlaps with standard JavaScript globals. `debug` Add debug prefix and suffix. `domprops` Mangle property names that overlaps with DOM properties. `keep_quoted` Only mangle unquoted properties. `regex` Only mangle matched property names. `reserved` List of names that should not be mangled. -b, --beautify [options] Beautify output/specify output options: `beautify` Enabled with `--beautify` by default. `preamble` Preamble to prepend to the output. You can use this to insert a comment, for example for licensing information. This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust for its presence. `quote_style` Quote style: 0 - auto 1 - single 2 - double 3 - original `wrap_iife` Wrap IIFEs in parentheses. Note: you may want to disable `negate_iife` under compressor options. -O, --output-opts [options] Specify output options (`beautify` disabled by default). -o, --output Output file path (default STDOUT). Specify `ast` or `spidermonkey` to write UglifyJS or SpiderMonkey AST as JSON to STDOUT respectively. --annotations Process and preserve comment annotations. (`/*@__PURE__*/` or `/*#__PURE__*/`) --no-annotations Ignore and discard comment annotations. --comments [filter] Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments that contain ""@license"" or ""@preserve"". You can optionally pass one of the following arguments to this flag: - ""all"" to keep all comments - a valid JS RegExp like `/foo/` or `/^!/` to keep only matching comments. Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when compression is on, because of dead code removal or cascading statements into sequences. --config-file Read `minify()` options from JSON file. -d, --define [=value] Global definitions. -e, --enclose [arg[:value]] Embed everything in a big function, with configurable argument(s) & value(s). --expression Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for parsing JSON). --ie Support non-standard Internet Explorer. Equivalent to setting `ie: true` in `minify()` for `compress`, `mangle` and `output` options. By default UglifyJS will not try to be IE-proof. --keep-fargs Do not mangle/drop function arguments. --keep-fnames Do not mangle/drop function names. Useful for code relying on Function.prototype.name. --module Process input as ES module (implies --toplevel) --no-module Avoid optimizations which may alter runtime behavior under prior versions of JavaScript. --name-cache File to hold mangled name mappings. --self Build UglifyJS as a library (implies --wrap UglifyJS) --source-map [options] Enable source map/specify source map options: `base` Path to compute relative paths from input files. `content` Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was generated from some other original code. Specify ""inline"" if the source map is included within the sources. `filename` Filename and/or location of the output source (sets `file` attribute in source map). `includeSources` Pass this flag if you want to include the content of source files in the source map as sourcesContent property. `names` Include symbol names in the source map. `root` Path to the original source to be included in the source map. `url` If specified, path to the source map to append in `//# sourceMappingURL`. --timings Display operations run time on STDERR. --toplevel Compress and/or mangle variables in top level scope. --v8 Support non-standard Chrome & Node.js Equivalent to setting `v8: true` in `minify()` for `mangle` and `output` options. By default UglifyJS will not try to be v8-proof. --verbose Print diagnostic messages. --warn Print warning messages. --webkit Support non-standard Safari/Webkit. Equivalent to setting `webkit: true` in `minify()` for `compress`, `mangle` and `output` options. By default UglifyJS will not try to be Safari-proof. --wrap Embed everything in a big function, making the exports and global variables available. You need to pass an argument to this option to specify the name that your module will take when included in, say, a browser. ``` Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file. Otherwise the output goes to STDOUT. ## CLI source map options UglifyJS can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for debugging your compressed JavaScript. To get a source map, pass `--source-map --output output.js` (source map will be written out to `output.js.map`). Additional options: - `--source-map ""filename=''""` to specify the name of the source map. The value of `filename` is only used to set `file` attribute (see [the spec][sm-spec]) in source map file. - `--source-map ""root=''""` to pass the URL where the original files can be found. - `--source-map ""names=false""` to omit symbol names if you want to reduce size of the source map file. - `--source-map ""url=''""` to specify the URL where the source map can be found. Otherwise UglifyJS assumes HTTP `X-SourceMap` is being used and will omit the `//# sourceMappingURL=` directive. For example: uglifyjs js/file1.js js/file2.js \ -o foo.min.js -c -m \ --source-map ""root=' The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the output in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`. The source mapping will refer to ` and ` (in fact it will list ` as the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and `js/file2.js`). ### Composed source map When you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as CoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful. Instead, you'd like to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript). UglifyJS has an option to take an input source map. Assuming you have a mapping from CoffeeScript compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript compressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original location. To use this feature pass `--source-map ""content='/path/to/input/source.map'""` or `--source-map ""content=inline""` if the source map is included inline with the sources. ## CLI compress options You need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor. Optionally you can pass a comma-separated list of [compress options](#compress-options). Options are in the form `foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want to set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`). Example: uglifyjs file.js -c toplevel,sequences=false ## CLI mangle options To enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`). The following (comma-separated) options are supported: - `eval` (default: `false`) mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `with` are used. - `reserved` (default: `[]`) when mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being mangled, you can declare those names with `--mangle reserved` pass a comma-separated list of names. For example: uglifyjs ... -m reserved=['$','require','exports'] to prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed. ### CLI mangling property names (`--mangle-props`) **Note:** THIS WILL PROBABLY BREAK YOUR CODE. Mangling property names is a separate step, different from variable name mangling. Pass `--mangle-props` to enable it. It will mangle all properties in the input code with the exception of built in DOM properties and properties in core JavaScript classes. For example: ```javascript // example.js var x = { baz_: 0, foo_: 1, calc: function() { return this.foo_ + this.baz_; } }; x.bar_ = 2; x[""baz_""] = 3; console.log(x.calc()); ``` Mangle all properties (except for JavaScript `builtins`): ```bash $ uglifyjs example.js -c -m --mangle-props ``` ```javascript var x={o:0,_:1,l:function(){return this._+this.o}};x.t=2,x.o=3,console.log(x.l()); ``` Mangle all properties except for `reserved` properties: ```bash $ uglifyjs example.js -c -...

[The source code is available at GitHub]( so you can check everything yourself. It never sends any of your personal info anywhere. #### [insert thing] doesn't look like it was in 2015 Twitter! Extension won't be pixel perfect copy of old Twitter. I just took general look and feel of it. #### I installed extension and my timeline feels kinda unusual You had algorithmical timeline enabled. By default OldTwitter turns on reverse chronological timeline, you can switch it back to algorithmical timeline in settings or using the switch on the right side. #### How do I visit original Twitter client after installing extension? You need to add `?newtwitter=true` to end of your current URL. There's also a ""Open this page in new Twitter"" button on all pages on bottom right. #### Where are the extension settings? Click on your profile picture on top-right and then Settings button. #### I don't like 2015 design, can I have something more modern There's a setting to use design from 2018. ## Hotkeys You can disable all hotkeys in settings.

MESHERY IS A CLOUD NATIVE COMPUTING FOUNDATION PROJECT A self-service engineering platform, Meshery, is the open source, cloud native manager that enables the design and management of all Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications (multi-cloud). Among other features, As an extensible platform, Meshery offers visual and collaborative GitOps, freeing you from the chains of YAML while managing Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments. Try Meshery in the Cloud Native Playground (teaser video) - [Functionality](#functionality) - [Meshery Architecture](#meshery-architecture) - [Join the Meshery community!](#join-the-meshery-community) - [Contributing](#contributing) - [Stargazers](#stargazers) - [License](#license) # Functionality Cloud Native Lifecycle Management Meshery manages the provisioning, configuration and operation of your Kubernetes clusters while supporting hundreds of different types of cloud native infrastructure integrations. Meshery also offers a catalog of curated design templates filled with configuration best practices. Using a GitOps-centric approach, visually and collaboratively design and manage your infrastructure and microservices. Extend Meshery as your self-service engineering platform by taking advantage of its [vast set of extensibility features]( including gRPC adapters, hot-loadable Reactjs packages and Golang plugins, subscriptions on NATS topics, consumable _and_ extendable API interfaces via REST and GraphQL. Multi-Cluster Kubernetes, Multi-Cloud, and Cloud Native Configuration Management Meshery supports 250+ integrations. Assess your cloud native infrastructure configuration against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery's configuration validator. Manage your workloads with confidence. Check your Kubernetes configuration for anti-patterns and avoid common pitfalls. Context-Aware Policies For Applications Leverage built-in relationships to enforce configuration best practices consistently from code to Kubernetes. Enhance development process by building custom rules in Open Policy Agent's Rego query language. Manage data plane intelligence with WebAssembly filters Dynamically load and manage your own WebAssembly filters in Envoy-based service meshes. See Image Hub. Performance Management Adhering to Cloud Native Standards In an effort to produce service mesh agnostic tooling, Meshery uses the Service Mesh Performance specification as a common format to capture and measure your infrastructure's performance against a universal cloud native performance index. As an implementation of Service Mesh Interface (SMI), Meshery participates in advancing cloud native infrastructure adoption through the standardization of APIs. Standardized Cloud Native Performance Management Meshery is the cloud native utility for uniformly managing the performance of microservices and the infrastructure that run them. As an implementation of the Service Mesh Performance ([SMP]( Meshery enables you to measure the value provided by Docker, Kubernetes, or a service mesh in the context of the overhead incurred. ## Meshery Architecture You may deploy Meshery internal to your cluster or external to your cluster.

Contributions, corrections & requests can be made on GitHub. ## Usage > [!IMPORTANT]\ > We ask that all users read our [legal disclaimer]( before using icons from Simple Icons. ### General Usage Icons can be downloaded as SVGs directly from [our website]( - simply click the download button of the icon you want, and the download will start automatically. ### CDN Usage Icons can be served from a CDN such as [jsDelivr]( or [Unpkg]( Simply use the `simple-icons` npm package and specify a version in the URL like the following: ```html ``` Where `[ICON SLUG]` is replaced by the [slug] of the icon you want to use, for example: ```html ``` These examples use the latest major version. This means you won't receive any updates following the next major release. You can use `@latest` instead to receive updates indefinitely. However, this will result in a `404` error if the icon is removed. #### CDN with colors We also provide a CDN service which allows you to use colors. ```html ``` Where `[COLOR]` is optional, and can be replaced by the [hex colors]( or [CSS keywords]( of the icon you want to you use. The color is defaulted to the HEX color of the icon shown in [simpleicons.org website]( `[DARK_MODE_COLOR]` is used for dark mode. The [CSS prefers-color-scheme]( will be used when a value is specified. For example: ```html ``` You can use a `viewbox=auto` parameter to get a auto-sized viewbox. This is useful if you want all icons rendered with consistent size: ```html ``` ### Node Usage The icons are also available through our npm package. To install, simply run: ```shell npm install simple-icons ``` All icons are imported from a single file, where `[ICON SLUG]` is replaced by a capitalized [slug]. We highly recommend using a bundler that can tree shake such as [webpack]( to remove the unused icon code: ```javascript // Import a specific icon by its slug as: // import { si[ICON SLUG] } from 'simple-icons' // For example: // use import/esm to allow tree shaking import { siSimpleicons } from 'simple-icons'; // or with require/cjs const { siSimpleicons } = require('simple-icons'); ``` It will return an icon object: ```javascript console.log(siSimpleicons); /* { title: 'Simple Icons', slug: 'simpleicons', hex: '111111', source: ' svg: '...', path: 'M12 12v-1.5c-2.484 ...', guidelines: ' license: { type: '...', url: ' } } NOTE: the `guidelines` entry will be `undefined` if we do not yet have guidelines for the icon. NOTE: the `license` entry will be `undefined` if we do not yet have license data for the icon. */ ``` If you need to iterate over all icons, use: ```javascript import * as icons from 'simple-icons'; ``` #### TypeScript Usage Type definitions are bundled with the package. ```typescript import type { SimpleIcon } from 'simple-icons'; ``` ### PHP Usage The icons are also available through our Packagist package. To install, simply run: ```shell composer require simple-icons/simple-icons ``` The package can then be used as follows, where `[ICON SLUG]` is replaced by a [slug]: ```php ... ?> ``` ## Third-Party Extensions The below are known extensions to third-party tools. | Extension | Author | | :- | :- | | [Blender add-on]( | [@mondeja]( | | [Boxy SVG library]( | [@Jarek]( | | [Drawio library]( | [@mondeja]( | | [Figma plugin]( | [@LitoMore]( | | [Miro app]( | [@LitoMore]( | | [Raycast extension]( | [@LitoMore]( | | [Stream Deck icon pack]( | [@mackenly]( | | | | [Webflow app]( | [@diegoliv]( | Maintain an extension?

relative-time-element,github/relative-time-element,3216,"['JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'Dockerfile']","['web-components', 'custom-elements', 'timezone', 'localization', 'keep']","# <relative-time> element Formats a timestamp as a localized string or as relative text that auto-updates in the user's browser. This allows the server to cache HTML fragments containing dates and lets the browser choose how to localize the displayed time according to the user's preferences. For example, the server may have cached the following generated markup: ```html April 1, 2014 4:30pm ``` Every visitor is served the same markup from the server's cache. When it reaches the browser, the custom `relative-time` JavaScript localizes the element's text into the local timezone and formatting. ```html 1 Apr 2014 21:30 ``` Dates are displayed before months, and a 24-hour clock is used, according to the user's browser settings. If the browser's JavaScript is disabled, the default text served in the cached markup is still displayed. ## Installation Available on [npm]( as [**@github/relative-time-element**]( ``` npm install @github/relative-time-element ``` This element uses the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` & `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` APIs, which are supported by all modern JS engines. If you need to support an older browser, you may need to introduce a polyfill for `Intl.DateTimeFormat` & `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`. ## Usage Add a `` element to your markup. Provide a default formatted date as the element's text content (e.g. April 1, 2014). It also MUST have a `datetime` attribute set to an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp. ```html April 1, 2014 ``` Depending on how far in the future this is being viewed, the element's text will be replaced with one of the following formats: - 6 years from now - 20 days from now - 4 hours from now - 7 minutes from now - just now - 30 seconds ago - a minute ago - 30 minutes ago - an hour ago - 20 hours ago - a day ago - 20 days ago - on Apr 1, 2014 So, a relative date phrase is used for up to a month and then the actual date is shown. #### Attributes | Property Name | Attribute Name | Possible Values | Default Value | |:---------------|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------| | `datetime` | `datetime` | `string` | - | | `format` | `format` | `'datetime'\|'relative'\|'duration'` | `'auto'` | | `date` | - | `Date \| null` | - | | `tense` | `tense` | `'auto'\|'past'\|'future'` | `'auto'` | | `precision` | `precision` | `'year'\|'month'\|'day'\|'hour'\|'minute'\|'second'` | `'second'` | | `threshold` | `threshold` | `string` | `'P30D'` | | `prefix` | `prefix` | `string` | `'on'` | | `formatStyle` | `format-style` | `'long'\|'short'\|'narrow'` | * | | `second` | `second` | `'numeric'\|'2-digit'\|undefined` | `undefined` | | `minute` | `minute` | `'numeric'\|'2-digit'\|undefined` | `undefined` | | `hour` | `hour` | `'numeric'\|'2-digit'\|undefined` | `undefined` | | `weekday` | `weekday` | `'short'\|'long'\|'narrow'\|undefined` | ** | | `day` | `day` | `'numeric'\|'2-digit'\|undefined` | `'numeric'` | | `month` | `month` | `'numeric'\|'2-digit'\|'short'\|'long'\|'narrow'\|undefined` | *** | | `year` | `year` | `'numeric'\|'2-digit'\|undefined` | **** | | `timeZoneName` | `time-zone-name` | `'long'\|'short'\|'shortOffset'\|'longOffset'` `\|'shortGeneric'\|'longGeneric'\|undefined` | `undefined` | *: If unspecified, `formatStyle` will return `'narrow'` if `format` is `'elapsed'` or `'micro'`, `'short'` if the format is `'relative'` or `'datetime'`, otherwise it will be `'long'`. **: If unspecified, `month` will return the same value as `formatStyle` whenever `format` is `'datetime'`, otherwise it will be `'short'`. ***: If unspecified, `weekday` will return the same value as `formatStyle` whenever `format` is `'datetime'`, otherwise it will be `undefined`. ****: If unspecified, `year` will return `'numeric'` if `datetime` represents the same year as the current year. It will return `undefined` if unspecified and if `datetime` represents a different year to the current year. ##### datetime (`string`) This is the datetime that the element is meant to represent. This must be a valid [ISO8601 DateTime]( It is also possible to use the `date` property on the element to set the date. `el.date` expects a `Date` object, while `el.datetime` expects a string. Setting one will override the other. ```html April 1, 2038 ``` ##### format (`'datetime'|'relative'|'duration'|'auto'|'micro'|'elapsed'`) Format can be either `'datetime'`, `'relative'`, or `'duration'`. It can also be one of several deprecated formats of `'auto'`, `'micro'`, or `'elapsed'`. The default format is `auto`, which is an alias for `relative`. In the next major version this will be `relative`. ###### `format=datetime` The `datetime` format will display a localised datetime, based on the other properties of the element. It uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to display the `datetime` in a localised format. Unless specified, it will consider `weekday` to be `'long'`, `month` to be `'long'`, and `'year'` to be `numeric` if the `datetime` is the same as the given year. Overriding `formatStyle` will change both `weekday` and `month` default values. Examples of this format with the default options and an `en` locale: - `Wed, 26 Aug 2021` - `Sat, 31 Dec` (assuming the `datetime` is same year as the current year) ###### `format=relative` The default `relative` format will display dates relative to the current time (unless they are past the `threshold` value - see below). The values are rounded to display a single unit, for example if the time between the given `datetime` and the current wall clock time exceeds a day, then the format will _only_ output in days, and will not display hours, minutes or seconds. Some examples of this format with the default options and an `en` locale: - `in 20 days` - `20 days ago` - `in 1 minute` - `on 31 Aug` (assuming the current date is the same year as the current year, and is more than 30 days away from 31 Aug) - `on 26 Aug 2021` (assuming the current date is more than 30 days away from 26 Aug 2021) ###### `format=duration` The `duration` format will display the time remaining (or elapsed time) from the given datetime, counting down the number of years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Any value that is `0` will be omitted from the display by default. Examples of this format with the default options and an `en` locale: - `4 hours, 2 minutes, 30 seconds` - `4 hours` - `8 days, 30 minutes, 1 second` ###### Deprecated Formats ###### `format=elapsed` This is similar to the `format=duration`, except the `formatStyle` defaults to `narrow`. Code that uses `format=elapsed` should migrate to `format=duration formatStyle=narrow`, as it will be removed in a later version. ###### `format=auto` This is identical to `format=relative`. Code that uses `format=auto` should migrate to `format=relative` as this will be the new default in a later version. ###### `format=micro` The `micro` format which will display relative dates (within the threshold) in a more compact format. Similar to `relative`, the `micro` format rounds values to the nearest largest value. Additionally, `micro` format will not round _lower_ than 1 minute, as such a `datetime` which is less than a minute from the current wall clock time will display `'1m'`. Code that uses `format=micro` should consider migrating to `format=relative` (perhaps with `formatStyle=narrow`), as `format=micro` can be difficult for users to understand, and can cause issues with assistive technologies. For example some screen readers (such as VoiceOver for mac) will read out `1m` as `1 meter`. ###### Cheatsheet | `format=datetime` | `format=relative` | `format=duration` | `format=micro` | `format=elapsed` | |:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:| | Wed 26 May 2024 | in 2 years | 2 years, 10 days, 3 hours, 20 minutes, 8 seconds | 2y | 2y 10d 3h 20m 8s | | Wed 26 Aug 2021 | 2 years ago | 2 years, 10 days, 3 hours, 8 seconds | 2y | 2y 10d 3h 8s | | Jan 15 2023 | in 30 days | 30 days, 4 hours, 20 minutes, 8 seconds | 30d | 30d 4h 20m 8s | | Dec 15 2022 | 21 minutes ago | 21 minutes, 30 seconds | 21m | 21m 30s | | Dec 15 2022 | 37 seconds ago | 37 seconds | 1m | 37s | ##### tense (`'auto'|'past'|'future'`, default: `auto`) If `format` is `'datetime'` then this value will be ignored. Tense can be used to prevent `duration` or `relative` formatted dates displaying dates in a tense other than the one specified. Setting `tense=past` will always display future `relative` dates as `now` and `duration` dates as `0 seconds`, while setting it to `future` will always display past dates `relative` as `now` and past `duration` dates as `0 seconds`. For example when the given `datetime` is 40 seconds behind of the current date: | `tense=`| format=duration | format=relative | |:-------:|:----------------:|:---------------:| | future | 0s | now | | past | 40s | 40s ago | | auto | 40s | 40s ago | ```html April 1, 2038 ``` ```html April 1, 2038 ``` #### precision (`'year'|'month'|'day'|'hour'|'minute'|'second'`, default: `'second'`) If `format` is `datetime` then this value will be ignored. Precision can be used to limit the display of an `relative` or `duration` formatted time. By default times will display down to the `second` level of precision. Changing this value will truncate the display by zeroing out any unit lower than the given unit, as such units smaller than the given unit won't be displayed during `duration`, and `relative` will display `now` if the time away from the current time is less than the given precision unit. | `precision=` | format=duration | |:-------------:|:-------------------:| | seconds | 2y 6m 10d 3h 20m 8s | | minutes | 2y 6m 10d 3h 20m | | hours | 2y 6m 10d 3h | | days | 2y 6m 10d | | months | 2y 6m | | years | 2y | | `precision=` | format=relative | |:-------------:|:-------------------:| | seconds | 25 seconds | | minutes | now | | hours | now | | days | now | | months | now | |...

drawio-desktop,jgraph/drawio-desktop,47241,"['JavaScript', 'Shell']","['javascript-applications', 'electron-app', 'graphics', 'diagram-editor']","About ----- **drawio-desktop** is a diagramming and whiteboarding desktop app based on [Electron]( that wraps the [core draw.io editor]( Download built binaries from the [releases section]( **Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don't change the code and accept it is provided ""as-is"", you can use it for any purpose. Security -------- draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript. No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. This means certain functionality for which we do not have a JavaScript implementation do not work in the Desktop build, namely .vsd and Gliffy import. Security and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no. Support ------- Support is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support. Purchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop. The draw.io integrations for Atlassian are sold by Seibert Media, they have no involvement with this project. Developing ---------- **draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively: `git clone --recursive To run this: 1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo) 2. export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode. 3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`. Note: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also. To release: 1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin. 2. Wait for the builds to complete ( and 3. Go to edit the preview release. 4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe` 5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe` 6. Add release notes 7. Publish release *Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them. Local Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder: - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io` - Windows: `C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\draw.io\` Not open-contribution --------------------- draw.io is closed to contributions. The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required is far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we'd have to basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented. We are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, & feature requests. We do not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we've made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for the long term viability of the project.","4.8k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, feature request, bug, blocked/upstream, help wanted, blocked/need-repro, Waiting for response, wontfix, windows-only, lacks details, issue template not filled, declined, question, notstale, no idea, multiple issues, low quality, invalid, good luck, enhancement, electron bug, duplicate, dependencies, completed, blocked/need-info"

Check out [this tutorial]( Why Jekyll? Read [Andrej Karpathy's blog post]( Why write a blog? Read [Rachel Thomas blog post]( ## Installing and Deploying For installation and deployment details please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). ## Customizing For customization details please refer to [CUSTOMIZE.md](CUSTOMIZE.md). ## Features ### Light/Dark Mode This template has a built-in light/dark mode. It detects the user preferred color scheme and automatically switches to it. You can also manually switch between light and dark mode by clicking on the sun/moon icon in the top right corner of the page. --- ### CV There are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in [assets/json/resume.json](assets/json/resume.json). It is a [known standard]( for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in [\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml). This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option. What this means is, if there is no resume data defined in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of [\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml) as fallback. []( --- ### People You can create a people page if you want to feature more than one person. Each person can have its own short bio, profile picture, and you can also set if every person will appear at the same or opposite sides. []( --- ### Publications Your publications' page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography. Simply edit [\_bibliography/papers.bib](_bibliography/papers.bib). You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing [\_pages/publications.md](_pages/publications.md). By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file. You can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the [assets/pdf/](assets/pdf/) directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: `abstract`, `altmetric`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, `pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`. []( --- ### Collections This Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories. The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`. Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page. Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page. []( You can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is. To do this, edit the collections in the [\_config.yml](_config.yml) file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to `_pages/projects.md`. --- ### Layouts **al-folio** comes with stylish layouts for pages and blog posts. #### The iconic style of Distill The theme allows you to create blog posts in the [distill.pub]( style: []( For more details on how to create distill-styled posts using `` tags, please refer to [the example]( #### Full support for math & code **al-folio** supports fast math typesetting through [MathJax]( and code syntax highlighting using [GitHub style]( Also supports [chartjs charts]( [mermaid diagrams]( and [TikZ figures]( #### Photos, Audio, Video and more Photo formatting is made simple using [Bootstrap's grid system]( Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and project pages, also with support for [video]( and [audio]( embeds: --- ### Other features #### GitHub's repositories and user stats **al-folio** uses [github-readme-stats]( and [github-profile-trophy]( to display GitHub repositories and user stats on the `/repositories/` page. []( Edit the `_data/repositories.yml` and change the `github_users` and `github_repos` lists to include your own GitHub profile and repositories to the `/repositories/` page. You may also use the following codes for displaying this in any other pages. ```html {% if site.data.repositories.github_users %} {% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %} {% include repository/repo_user.liquid username=user %} {% endfor %} {% endif %} {% if site.repo_trophies.enabled %} {% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %} {% if site.data.repositories.github_users.size > 1 %} {{ user }} {% endif %} {% include repository/repo_trophies.liquid username=user %} {% endfor %} {% endif %} {% if site.data.repositories.github_repos %} {% for repo in site.data.repositories.github_repos %} {% include repository/repo.liquid repository=repo %} {% endfor %} {% endif %} ``` --- #### Theming A variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from. The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the `--global-theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file. Other color variables are listed there as well. The stock theme color options available can be found at [\_sass/\_variables.scss](_sass/_variables.scss). You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of use across the template. --- #### Social media previews **al-folio** supports preview images on social media. To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element. You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews. This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable. If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews. --- #### Atom (RSS-like) Feed It generates an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your posts, useful for Atom and RSS readers. The feed is reachable simply by typing after your homepage `/feed.xml`. E.g. assuming your website mountpoint is the main folder, you can type `yourusername.github.io/feed.xml` --- #### Related posts By default, there will be a related posts section on the bottom of the blog posts. These are generated by selecting the `max_related` most recent posts that share at least `min_common_tags` tags with the current post. If you do not want to display related posts on a specific post, simply add `related_posts: false` to the front matter of the post. If you want to disable it for all posts, simply set `enabled` to false in the `related_blog_posts` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml). --- #### Code quality checks Currently, we run some checks to ensure that the code quality and generated site are good. The checks are done using GitHub Actions and the following tools: - [Prettier]( - check if the formatting of the code follows the style guide - [lychee]( - check for broken links - [Axe]( (need to run manually) - do some accessibility testing We decided to keep `Axe` runs manual because fixing the issues are not straightforward and might be hard...

lab-css-flexbox-slack,ironhack-labs/lab-css-flexbox-slack,33,"['HTML', 'CSS']",[],"# CSS | Flexbox Slack Clone Learning Goals This exercise allows you to practice and apply the concepts and techniques taught in class. Upon completion of this exercise, you will be able to: - Develop a fully responsive webpage using the provided designs as a guide. - Use CSS _media queries_ to adapt the page layout to different screen sizes. - Use _Flexbox_ to layout and position elements on a webpage dynamically as either rows or columns. - Use the CSS `position` property to position elements on a webpage. - Display images on a webpage and make them responsive according to the viewport size. - Submit completed work using Git and GitHub by creating a Pull Request. ## Introduction **Slack** is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services, or in simpler terms, an online chat application. Slack app is used in daily communications within different teams in companies, but today we will be focusing on their landing page. In today's lab, we'll recreate Slack's landing page while ensuring it's responsive and adapts well to different screens. You can see the _desktop (large) screen_ version of the web page we will be cloning [here](). The lab's goal is to create a _responsive_ landing page using **CSS** and **Flexbox**, starting with the styles for the mobile (small) screens first and then adapting the layout to larger screens using _media queries_. We have provided you with the all the HTML and the images you will need for the page, as well as the screenshots to guide you with the styles and layout for each screen size. ## Getting Started - Fork this repo - Clone this repo ## Submission - Upon completion, run the following commands: ```bash git add . git commit -m ""done"" git push origin master ``` - Create a Pull Request and submit your assignment. ## Instructions The `starter_code` folder contains all the files you'll need. The `images` folder contains all the images you'll need for your page, although most of them are already displayed on the page. **The `index.html` already contains all the text and content needed. We will be focusing on the CSS and styling!** During each iteration, the first step you should do is to inspect the provided screenshots. These are included in each iteration, along with a preview of the final result. Use these as a starting point for implementing your styles. --- ### Iteration 1 | Mobile Screens (width < 768px) Mobile first, right? :wink: We will start by focusing on the styles for mobile screens first! :iphone: Oh! Remember to use **Flexbox** to create the layout and display the content in rows or columns from the start. You'll be working on adapting the layout to different screen sizes in the following iterations, so it's essential that you start using Flexbox from beginning to end! When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Mobile]() Use the following page screenshot as the guide: Screenshot - Mobile Screens [Back to top](#iteration-1--mobile-screens-width--768px) --- ### Iteration 2 | Small Screens (width > 768px and width < 1024px) Let's start growing our screen size. In this iteration, you will work on making the website look great on small screens (iPads, tablets, or larger smartphones). You will have to use CSS [media queries]( to apply the style and layout changes. Take a look at the preview and the screenshot to see the changes that are needed. Your task is to work on the following: - The **header** should go from 1 column to display 2 columns: one with the content and buttons and the other with the image. - In the **section ""TRUSTED BY COMPANIES...""**, the **company logos** should be displayed in a single row. - The **section ""Teams large and small rely on Slack""** should have the **list elements** displayed horizontally as rows. - In the **footer**, the **list elements** that were previously displayed as a column should now be displayed horizontally in a row. When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Small Screens]() Use the following page screenshot as the guide: Screenshot - Small Screens [Back to top](#iteration-2--small-screens-width--768px-and-width--1024px) --- ### BONUS: Iteration 3 | Medium Screens (width > 1024px and width < 1440px) We'll continue by focusing on devices with medium-sized screens (notebooks and bigger tablets). Similar to the previous iteration, you will have to use CSS media queries to apply the style and layout changes. The most noticeable changes in this viewport size are: - The **navbar** should now display **all the menu links**. The previously displayed **menu icon** should now be hidden. - The **section ""Welcome to your new digital HQ""** should now display the buttons horizontally next to each other. When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Medium Screens]() Use the following page screenshot as the guide: Screenshot - Medium Screens [Back to top](#iteration-3--medium-screens-width--1024px-and-width--1440px) --- ### BONUS: Iteration 4 | Large Screens (width > 1440px) Last one! Some small changes and we are done! In this iteration we are targeting large-screen devices such as desktops and laptops: - The **signup buttons** in the **header** should now be displayed horizontally, next to each other. - Additionally, the **image** in the **header** should be centered and fully visible. When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Large Screens]() Use the following page screenshot as the guide: Screenshot - Large Screens [Back to top](#iteration-4--large-screens-width--1440px) **Happy coding!** :blue_heart: ## FAQs I am stuck in the exercise and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start. If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear question about the specific issue you are facing. This will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions. For example, is it a concept that you don't understand, or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources. Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you will be able to start working toward the solution. [Back to top](#faqs) How do I center align HTML text elements? To center align HTML _text elements_, you can use the `text-align` property and set it to `center`. This property can be applied to any _inline_ or _block-level_ element. Here is an example of how you can use the `text-align` property to center align multiple text elements: **HTML** ```html This is a title This is some text in here ``` **CSS** ```css /* CSS */ p { text-align: center; /* Center align all p elements */ } h2 { text-align: center; /* Center align all h2 elements */ } ``` This will center align all `p` and `h2` elements within the parent `div`. For more information, check: [W3C: Centering Things]( [Back to top](#faqs) How do I center align HTML block elements? To center align a block-level element, such as a `div`, `h1`, etc., you can use the `margin` property and set it to `auto`. This will center the element horizontally within its parent container. Here is an example of how you can do this: **HTML** ```html Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. ``` **CSS** ```css /* CSS */ div { width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; } ``` This will set the `width` property of the `div` to 500 pixels and we set the left and right margins to be equal by using `margin: 0 auto;`. [Back to top](#faqs) How do I center align an HTML image element? There are a few ways you can center align an image element. ##### 1. Align an image using `text-align` To center an image element in HTML, you can use the `text-align` property on the parent element, such as `div`. Example: **HTML** ```html ``` **CSS** ```css div { text-align: center; } ``` This will center align all the children elements within the `section` element, including the `img` element. ##### 2. Align an image as a block element The other way is converting the image into a block element and using `margin: 0 auto`. Here is an example: **HTML** ```html ``` **CSS** ```css img { display: block; margin: 0 auto; } ``` This will center the image horizontally within the parent `section` element. The `display: block` property is used to make the image a _block-level_ element, allowing the `margin: 0 auto` property to work. The `margin: 0 auto` property sets the left and right margins to be equal, centering the element within its parent container. [Back to top](#faqs) How can I center align elements within a Flexbox container? To center align elements within a Flexbox parent container, you can use the `justify-content` property and set it to `center`. This will horizontally center the elements within the Flexbox container. **Example:** ```css .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; /* Center elements horizontally */ } ``` You can also use the `align-items` property and set it to `center` to vertically center align the elements within the Flexbox container. Example: ```css .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; /* Center elements horizontally */ align-items: center; /* Center elements vertically */ } ``` For more information and an interactive Flexbox guide, check: [An Interactive Guide to Flexbox]( [Back to top](#faqs) How can I change the header from having 1 column to having 2 columns using Flexbox? To change the header of an HTML page from having one column to having two columns using Flexbox, you should do the following in your CSS: 1. Use the `display` property and set it to `flex`. 2. Add the `flex-direction` property and set it to `column` to arrange the elements in a column. 3. Add the `justify-content` property to align the elements horizontally 4. Use the `align-items` property to align them vertically. ```css header { displ...

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings with free developer tiers. The scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a grey line sometimes, so this is opinionated; please don't feel offended if I don't accept your contribution. This list results from Pull Requests, reviews, ideas, and work done by 1100+ people. You can also help by sending [Pull Requests]( to add more services or remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired. []( **NOTE**: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. To be eligible, a service must offer a free tier, not just a free trial. The free tier must be for at least a year if it is time-bucketed. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine, but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers. # Table of Contents * [Major Cloud Providers' Always-Free Limits](#major-cloud-providers) * [Cloud management solutions](#cloud-management-solutions) * [Analytics, Events, and Statistics](#analytics-events-and-statistics) * [APIs, Data and ML](#apis-data-and-ml) * [Artifact Repos](#artifact-repos) * [BaaS](#baas) * [Low-code Platform](#low-code-platform) * [CDN and Protection](#cdn-and-protection) * [CI and CD](#ci-and-cd) * [CMS](#cms) * [Code Generation](#code-generation) * [Code Quality](#code-quality) * [Code Search and Browsing](#code-search-and-browsing) * [Crash and Exception Handling](#crash-and-exception-handling) * [Data Visualization on Maps](#data-visualization-on-maps) * [Managed Data Services](#managed-data-services) * [Design and UI](#design-and-ui) * [Design Inspiration](#design-inspiration) * [Dev Blogging Sites](#dev-blogging-sites) * [DNS](#dns) * [Docker Related](#docker-related) * [Domain](#domain) * [Education and Career Development](#education-and-career-development) * [Email](#email) * [Feature Toggles Management Platforms](#feature-toggles-management-platforms) * [Font](#font) * [Forms](#forms) * [Generative AI](#generative-ai) * [IaaS](#iaas) * [IDE and Code Editing](#ide-and-code-editing) * [International Mobile Number Verification API and SDK](#international-mobile-number-verification-api-and-sdk) * [Issue Tracking and Project Management](#issue-tracking-and-project-management) * [Log Management](#log-management) * [Mobile App Distribution and Feedback](#mobile-app-distribution-and-feedback) * [Management Systems](#management-system) * [Messaging and Streaming](#messaging-and-streaming) * [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous) * [Monitoring](#monitoring) * [PaaS](#paas) * [Package Build System](#package-build-system) * [Payment and Billing Integration](#payment-and-billing-integration) * [Privacy Management](#privacy-management) * [Screenshot APIs](#screenshot-apis) * [Flutter Related and Building IOS Apps without Mac](#flutter-related-and-building-ios-apps-without-mac) * [Search](#search) * [Security and PKI](#security-and-pki) * [Authentication, Authorization, and User Management](#authentication-authorization-and-user-management) * [Source Code Repos](#source-code-repos) * [Storage and Media Processing](#storage-and-media-processing) * [Tunneling, WebRTC, Web Socket Servers and Other Routers](#tunneling-webrtc-web-socket-servers-and-other-routers) * [Testing](#testing) * [Tools for Teams and Collaboration](#tools-for-teams-and-collaboration) * [Translation Management](#translation-management) * [Vagrant Related](#vagrant-related) * [Visitor Session Recording](#visitor-session-recording) * [Web Hosting](#web-hosting) * [Commenting Platforms](#commenting-platforms) * [Browser based hardware emulation](#browser-based-hardware-emulation-written-in-javascript) * [Remote Desktop Tools](#remote-desktop-tools) * [Game Development](#game-development) * [Other Free Resources](#other-free-resources) ## Major Cloud Providers * [Google Cloud Platform]( * App Engine - 28 frontend instance hours per day, nine backend instance hours per day * Cloud Firestore - 1GB storage, 50,000 reads, 20,000 writes, 20,000 deletes per day * Compute Engine - 1 non-preemptible e2-micro, 30GB HDD, 5GB snapshot storage (restricted to certain regions), 1 GB network egress from North America to all region destinations (excluding China and Australia) per month * Cloud Storage - 5GB, 1GB network egress * Cloud Shell - Web-based Linux shell/primary IDE with 5GB of persistent storage. 60 hours limit per week * Cloud Pub/Sub - 10GB of messages per month * Cloud Functions - 2 million invocations per month (includes both background and HTTP invocations) * Cloud Run - 2 million requests per month, 360,000 GB-seconds memory, 180,000 vCPU-seconds of compute time, 1 GB network egress from North America per month * Google Kubernetes Engine - No cluster management fee for one zonal cluster.

authelia,authelia/authelia,20061,"['Go', 'TypeScript', 'HTML']","['totp', 'u2f', 'ldap', 'sso-authentication', 'yubikey']","[]( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( [][Apache 2.0] []( []( []( **Authelia** is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for [reverse proxies](#proxy-support) by allowing, denying, or redirecting requests. Documentation is available at [ The following is a simple diagram of the architecture: **Authelia** can be installed as a standalone service from the [AUR]( [APT]( [FreeBSD Ports]( or using a [static binary]( [.deb package](( as a container on [Docker] or [Kubernetes]. Deployment can be orchestrated via the Helm [Chart]( (beta) leveraging ingress controllers and ingress configurations. Here is what Authelia's portal looks like: ## Features summary This is a list of the key features of Authelia: * Several second factor methods: * **[Security Keys]( that support [FIDO2][WebAuthn] with devices like a [YubiKey]. * **[Time-based One-Time password]( with compatible authenticator applications. * **[Mobile Push Notifications]( with [Duo]( * Password reset with identity verification using email confirmation. * Access restriction after too many invalid authentication attempts. * Fine-grained access control using rules which match criteria like subdomain, user, user group membership, request uri, request method, and network. * Choice between one-factor and two-factor policies per-rule. * Support of basic authentication for endpoints protected by the one-factor policy. * Highly available using a remote database and Redis as a highly available KV store. * Compatible with [Traefik]( out of the box using the [ForwardAuth]( middleware. * Curated configuration from [LinuxServer]( via their [SWAG]( container as well as a [guide]( * Compatible with [Caddy] using the [forward_auth]( directive. * Kubernetes Support: * Compatible with several Kubernetes ingress controllers: * [ingress-nginx]( * [Traefik Kubernetes CRD]( * [Traefik Kubernetes Ingress]( * [Istio]( * Beta support for installing via Helm using our [Charts]( * Beta support for [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0]( For more details take a look at the [Overview]( If you want to know more about the roadmap, follow [Roadmap]( ## Proxy support Authelia works in combination with [nginx], [Traefik], [Caddy], [Skipper], [Envoy], or [HAProxy]. ## Getting Started See the [Get Started Guide]( or one of the curated examples below. ### docker-compose The `docker-compose` bundles act as a starting point for anyone wanting to see Authelia in action. You will have to customize them to your needs as they come with self-signed certificates. #### [Local]( The Local compose bundle is intended to test Authelia without worrying about configuration. It's meant to be used for scenarios where the server is not be exposed to the internet. Domains will be defined in the local hosts file and self-signed certificates will be utilised. #### [Lite]( The Lite compose bundle is intended for scenarios where the server will be exposed to the internet, domains and DNS will need to be setup accordingly and certificates will be generated through LetsEncrypt. The Lite element refers to minimal external dependencies; File based user storage, SQLite based configuration storage. In this configuration, the service will not scale well. ## Deployment Now that you have tested **Authelia** and you want to try it out in your own infrastructure, you can learn how to deploy and use it with [Deployment]( This guide will show you how to deploy it on bare metal as well as on [Kubernetes]( ## Security Authelia takes security very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Authelia, please see our [Security Policy]( For more information about [security]( related matters, please read [the documentation]( ## Contact Options Several contact options exist for our community, the primary one being [Matrix](#matrix). These are in addition to [GitHub issues]( for creating a [new issue]( ### Matrix Community members are invited to join the [Matrix Space]( which includes both the [Support Room]( and the [Contributing Room]( - The core team members are identified as administrators in the Space and individual Rooms. - All channels are linked to [Discord](#discord). ### Discord Community members are invited to join the [Discord Server]( - The core team members are identified by the **CORE TEAM** role in Discord. - The [#support] and [#contributing] channels are linked to [Matrix](#matrix). ### Email You can contact the core team by email via [team@authelia.com](mailto:team@authelia.com). Please note the [security@authelia.com](mailto:security@authelia.com) is also available but is strictly reserved for [security] related matters. ## Breaking changes Since Authelia is still under active development, it is subject to breaking changes. It's recommended to pin a version tag instead of using the `latest` tag and reading the [release notes]( before upgrading. This is where you will find information about breaking changes and what you should do to overcome said changes. ## Why Open Source? You might wonder why Authelia is open source while it adds a great deal of security and user experience to your infrastructure at zero cost. It is open source because we firmly believe that security should be available for all to benefit in the face of the battlefield which is the Internet, with near zero effort. Additionally, keeping the code open source is a way to leave it auditable by anyone who is willing to contribute. This way, you can be confident that the product remains secure and does not act maliciously. It's important to keep in mind Authelia is not directly exposed on the Internet (your reverse proxies are) however, it's still the control plane for your internal security so take care of it! ## Contribute If you want to contribute to Authelia, please read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). Authelia exists thanks to all the people who contribute so don't be shy, come chat with us on either [Matrix](#matrix) or [Discord](#discord) and start contributing too.

Maybe a service is down. `docker-compose ps`. Yep, it's that microservice that's still buggy. No issue, I'll just restart it: `docker-compose restart`. Okay now let's try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. `docker-compose ps`. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with `docker compose logs --follow myservice` but that dies everytime the service dies so I'd need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run `docker-compose up myservice` and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just `up` it again, but now I've got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do `ctrl+P,Q`, but... wait, that's not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can't remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service. What a headache! Memorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker's goal is to make that dream a reality. - [Requirements]( - [Installation]( - [Usage]( - [Keybindings](/docs/keybindings) - [Cool Features]( - [Contributing]( - [Video Tutorial]( - [Config Docs](/docs/Config.md) - [Twitch Stream]( - [FAQ]( ## Requirements - Docker >= **1.13** (API >= **1.25**) - Docker-Compose >= **1.23.2** (optional) ## Installation ### Homebrew Normally `lazydocker` formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you to tap our formula to get frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too. **Tap**: ```sh brew install jesseduffield/lazydocker/lazydocker ``` **Core**: ```sh brew install lazydocker ``` ### Scoop (Windows) You can install `lazydocker` using [scoop]( ```sh scoop install lazydocker ``` ### Chocolatey (Windows) You can install `lazydocker` using [Chocolatey]( ```sh choco install lazydocker ``` ### asdf-vm You can install [asdf-lazydocker plugin]( using [asdf-vm]( #### Setup (Once) ```sh asdf plugin add lazydocker ``` #### For Install / Upgrade ```sh asdf list all lazydocker asdf install lazydocker latest asdf global lazydocker latest ``` ### Binary Release (Linux/OSX/Windows) You can manually download a binary release from [the release page]( Automated install/update, don't forget to always verify what you're piping into bash: ```sh curl | bash ``` The script installs downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` directory by default, but it can be changed by setting `DIR` environment variable. ### Go Required Go Version >= **1.19** ```sh go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker@latest ``` Required Go version >= **1.8**, <= **1.17** ```sh go get github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker ``` ### Arch Linux AUR You can install lazydocker using the [AUR]( by running: ```sh yay -S lazydocker ``` ### Docker []( []( []( 1.

Run the container ```sh docker run --rm -it -v \ /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ -v /yourpath:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker \ lazyteam/lazydocker ``` - Don't forget to change `/yourpath` to an actual path you created to store lazydocker's config - You can also use this [docker-compose.yml]( - You might want to create an alias, for example: ```sh echo ""alias lzd='docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /yourpath/config:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker lazyteam/lazydocker'"" >> ~/.zshrc ``` For development, you can build the image using: ```sh git clone cd lazydocker docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \ --build-arg BUILD_DATE=`date -u +""%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ""` \ --build-arg VCS_REF=`git rev-parse --short HEAD` \ --build-arg VERSION=`git describe --abbrev=0 --tag` \ . ``` If you encounter a compatibility issue with Docker bundled binary, try rebuilding the image with the build argument `--build-arg DOCKER_VERSION=""v$(docker -v | cut -d"" "" -f3 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev)""` so that the bundled docker binary matches your host docker binary version. ## Usage Call `lazydocker` in your terminal. I personally use this a lot so I've made an alias for it like so: ``` echo ""alias lzd='lazydocker'"" >> ~/.zshrc ``` (you can substitute .zshrc for whatever rc file you're using) - Basic video tutorial [here]( - List of keybindings [here](/docs/keybindings). ## Cool features everything is one keypress away (or one click away! Mouse support FTW): - viewing the state of your docker or docker-compose container environment at a glance - viewing logs for a container/service - viewing ascii graphs of your containers' metrics so that you can not only feel but also look like a developer - customising those graphs to measure nearly any metric you want - attaching to a container/service - restarting/removing/rebuilding containers/services - viewing the ancestor layers of a given image - pruning containers, images, or volumes that are hogging up disk space ## Contributing There is still a lot of work to go! Please check out the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). For contributor discussion about things not better discussed here in the repo, join the discord channel ## Donate If you would like to support the development of lazydocker, consider [sponsoring me]( (github is matching all donations dollar-for-dollar for 12 months) ## Social If you want to see what I (Jesse) am up to in terms of development, follow me on [twitter]( or watch me program on [twitch]( ## FAQ ### How do I edit my config? By opening lazydocker, clicking on the 'project' panel in the top left, and pressing 'o' (or 'e' if your editor is vim). See [Config Docs](/docs/Config.md) ### How do I get text to wrap in my main panel? In the future I want to make this the default, but for now there are some CPU issues that arise with wrapping. If you want to enable wrapping, use `gui.wrapMainPanel: true` ### How do you select text? Because we support mouse events, you will need to hold option while dragging the mouse to indicate you're trying to select text rather than click on something. Alternatively you can disable mouse events via the `gui.ignoreMouseEvents` config value. Mac Users: See [Issue #190]( for other options. ### Why can't I see my container's logs? By default we only show logs from the last hour, so that we're not putting too much strain on the machine. This may be why you can't see logs when you first start lazydocker. This can be overwritten in the config's `commandTemplates` If you are running lazydocker in Docker container, it is a know bug, that you can't see logs or CPU usage. ### Why isn't my docker-compose environment being used? By default Compose V1 (`docker-compose` with the hyphen) is used as the docker-compose command. You will need to make sure you have the `docker-compose` command available for lazydocker to be able to use. If you use Compose V2 (`docker compose` without the hyphen), alternatively, you can change the docker-compose command used via the `commandTemplates.dockerCompose` config value. ## Alternatives - [docui]( - Skanehira beat me to the punch on making a docker terminal UI, so definitely check out that repo as well! I think the two repos can live in harmony though: lazydocker is more about managing existing containers/services, and docui is more about creating and configuring them. - [Portainer]( - Portainer tries to solve the same problem but it's accessed via your browser rather than your terminal. It also supports docker swarm. - See [Awesome Docker list]( for similar tools to work with Docker.","1.1k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, enhancement, bug, discussion, hacktoberfest, good first issue, docker-image, dependencies, wontfix, question, invalid, ignore-for-release, help wanted, duplicate, brew-packaging, binary-release"
skopeo,containers/skopeo,7512,"['Go', 'Shell', 'Makefile']",[],"---- `skopeo` is a command line utility that performs various operations on container images and image repositories. `skopeo` does not require the user to be running as root to do most of its operations. `skopeo` does not require a daemon to be running to perform its operations. `skopeo` can work with [OCI images]( as well as the original Docker v2 images. Skopeo works with API V2 container image registries such as [docker.io]( and [quay.io]( registries, private registries, local directories and local OCI-layout directories. Skopeo can perform operations which consist of: * Copying an image from and to various storage mechanisms. For example you can copy images from one registry to another, without requiring privilege. * Inspecting a remote image showing its properties including its layers, without requiring you to pull the image to the host. * Deleting an image from an image repository. * Syncing an external image repository to an internal registry for air-gapped deployments. * When required by the repository, skopeo can pass the appropriate credentials and certificates for authentication. Skopeo operates on the following image and repository types: * containers-storage:docker-reference An image located in a local containers/storage image store. Both the location and image store are specified in /etc/containers/storage.conf. (This is the backend for [Podman]( [CRI-O]( [Buildah]( and friends) * dir:path An existing local directory path storing the manifest, layer tarballs and signatures as individual files. This is a non-standardized format, primarily useful for debugging or noninvasive container inspection. * docker://docker-reference An image in a registry implementing the ""Docker Registry HTTP API V2"". By default, uses the authorization state in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`, which is set using `skopeo login`. * docker-archive:path[:docker-reference] An image is stored in a `docker save`-formatted file. docker-reference is only used when creating such a file, and it must not contain a digest. * docker-daemon:docker-reference An image docker-reference stored in the docker daemon internal storage. docker-reference must contain either a tag or a digest. Alternatively, when reading images, the format can also be docker-daemon:algo:digest (an image ID). * oci:path:tag An image tag in a directory compliant with ""Open Container Image Layout Specification"" at path. [Obtaining skopeo](./install.md) - For a detailed description how to install or build skopeo, see [install.md](./install.md). Skopeo is also available as a Container Image on [quay.io]( For more information, see the [Skopeo Image]( page. ## Inspecting a repository `skopeo` is able to _inspect_ a repository on a container registry and fetch images layers. The _inspect_ command fetches the repository's manifest and it is able to show you a `docker inspect`-like json output about a whole repository or a tag. This tool, in contrast to `docker inspect`, helps you gather useful information about a repository or a tag before pulling it (using disk space). The inspect command can show you which tags are available for the given repository, the labels the image has, the creation date and operating system of the image and more.

**url** or **endpoint** to crawl and accepts single or multiple inputs. Input URL can be provided using `-u` option, and multiple values can be provided using comma-separated input, similarly **file** input is supported using `-list` option and additionally piped input (stdin) is also supported. #### URL Input ```sh katana -u ``` #### Multiple URL Input (comma-separated) ```sh katana -u ``` #### List Input ```bash $ cat url_list.txt ``` ``` katana -list url_list.txt ``` #### STDIN (piped) Input ```sh echo | katana ``` ```sh cat domains | | katana ``` Example running katana - ```console katana -u __ __ / /_____ _/ /____ ____ ___ _ / '_/ _ / __/ _ / _ \/ _ / /_/\_\\_,_/\__/\_,_/_//_/\_,_/ v0.0.1 projectdiscovery.io [WRN] Use with caution. You are responsible for your actions. [WRN] Developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage. ``` ## Crawling Mode ### Standard Mode Standard crawling modality uses the standard go http library under the hood to handle HTTP requests/responses. This modality is much faster as it doesn't have the browser overhead. Still, it analyzes HTTP responses body as is, without any javascript or DOM rendering, potentially missing post-dom-rendered endpoints or asynchronous endpoint calls that might happen in complex web applications depending, for example, on browser-specific events. ### Headless Mode Headless mode hooks internal headless calls to handle HTTP requests/responses directly within the browser context. This offers two advantages: - The HTTP fingerprint (TLS and user agent) fully identify the client as a legitimate browser - Better coverage since the endpoints are discovered analyzing the standard raw response, as in the previous modality, and also the browser-rendered one with javascript enabled. Headless crawling is optional and can be enabled using `-headless` option. Here are other headless CLI options - ```console katana -h headless Flags: HEADLESS: -hl, -headless enable headless hybrid crawling (experimental) -sc, -system-chrome use local installed chrome browser instead of katana installed -sb, -show-browser show the browser on the screen with headless mode -ho, -headless-options string[] start headless chrome with additional options -nos, -no-sandbox start headless chrome in --no-sandbox mode -cdd, -chrome-data-dir string path to store chrome browser data -scp, -system-chrome-path string use specified chrome browser for headless crawling -noi, -no-incognito start headless chrome without incognito mode -cwu, -chrome-ws-url string use chrome browser instance launched elsewhere with the debugger listening at this URL -xhr, -xhr-extraction extract xhr requests ``` *`-no-sandbox`* ---- Runs headless chrome browser with **no-sandbox** option, useful when running as root user. ```console katana -u -headless -no-sandbox ``` *`-no-incognito`* ---- Runs headless chrome browser without incognito mode, useful when using the local browser. ```console katana -u -headless -no-incognito ``` *`-headless-options`* ---- When crawling in headless mode, additional chrome options can be specified using `-headless-options`, for exa...

AFAIK, *croc* is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following: - allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay) - provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE) - enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac) - allows **multiple file** transfers - allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted - local server or port-forwarding **not needed** - **ipv6-first** with ipv4 fallback - can **use proxy**, like tor For more information about `croc`, see [my blog post]( or read a [recent interview I did]( ## Install Download [the latest release for your system]( or install a release from the command-line: ``` curl | bash ``` On macOS you can install the latest release with [Homebrew]( ``` brew install croc ``` On macOS you can also install the latest release with [MacPorts]( ``` sudo port selfupdate sudo port install croc ``` On Windows you can install the latest release with [Scoop]( [Chocolatey]( or [Winget]( ``` scoop install croc ``` ``` choco install croc ``` ``` winget install schollz.croc ``` On Unix you can install the latest release with [Nix]( ``` nix-env -i croc ``` On Alpine Linux you have to install dependencies first: ``` apk add bash coreutils wget -qO- | bash ``` On Arch Linux you can install the latest release with `pacman`: ``` pacman -S croc ``` On Fedora you can install with `dnf`: ``` dnf install croc ``` On Gentoo you can install with `portage`: ``` emerge net-misc/croc ``` On Termux you can install with `pkg`: ``` pkg install croc ``` On FreeBSD you can install with `pkg`: ``` pkg install croc ``` Or, you can [install Go]( and build from source (requires Go 1.17+): ``` go install github.com/schollz/croc/v10@latest ``` On Android there is a 3rd party F-Droid app [available to download]( ## Usage To send a file, simply do: ``` $ croc send [file(s)-or-folder] Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB) Code is: code-phrase ``` Then to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do ``` croc code-phrase ``` The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement ([PAKE]( which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption. There are a number of configurable options (see `--help`). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using `--remember`. ### Custom code phrase You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters). ``` croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder] ``` ### Allow overwriting without prompt By default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the `--overwrite` flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite: ``` croc --yes --overwrite ``` ### Use pipes - stdin and stdout You can pipe to `croc`: ``` cat [filename] | croc send ``` In this case `croc` will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like ""croc-stdin-123456789"". To receive to `stdout` at you can always just use the `--yes` will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to `stdout`. ``` croc --yes [code-phrase] > out ``` All of the other text printed to the console is going to `stderr` so it will not interfere with the message going to `stdout`. ### Send text Sometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with `croc`: ``` croc send --text ""hello world"" ``` This will automatically tell the receiver to use `stdout` when they receive the text so it will be displayed. ### Use a proxy You can use a proxy as your connection to the relay by adding a proxy address with `--socks5`. For example, you can send via a tor relay: ``` croc --socks5 ""127.0.0.1:9050"" send SOMEFILE ``` ### Change encryption curve You can choose from several different elliptic curves to use for encryption by using the `--curve` flag. Only the recipient can choose the curve. For example, receive a file using the P-521 curve: ``` croc --curve p521 ``` Available curves are P-256, P-348, P-521 and SIEC. P-256 is the default curve. ### Change hash algorithm You can choose from several different hash algorithms. The default is the `xxhash` algorithm which is fast and thorough. If you want to optimize for speed you can use the `imohash` algorithm which is even faster, but since it samples files (versus reading the whole file) it can mistakenly determine that a file is the same on the two computers transferring - though this is only a problem if you are syncing files versus sending a new file to a computer. ``` croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE ``` ### Self-host relay The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. By default, `croc` uses a public relay but you can also run your own relay: ``` croc relay ``` By default it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. Make sure to open those up. You can customize the ports (e.g. `croc relay --ports 1111,1112`), but you must have a minimum of **2** ports for the relay. The first port is for communication and the subsequent ports are used for the multiplexed data transfer. You can send files using your relay by entering `--relay` to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own. ``` croc --relay ""myrelay.example.com:9009"" send [filename] ``` Note, when sending, you only need to include the first port (the communication port). The subsequent ports for data transfer will be transmitted back to the user from the relay. #### Self-host relay (docker) If it's easier you can also run a relay with Docker: ``` docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc ``` Be sure to include the password for the relay otherwise any requests will be rejected. ``` croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay ""myreal.example.com:9009"" send [filename] ``` Note: when including `--pass YOURPASSWORD` you can instead pass a file with the password, e.g. `--pass FILEWITHPASSWORD`. ## License MIT ## Acknowledgements `croc` has gone through many iterations, and I am awed by all the great contributions!

juicefs,juicedata/juicefs,9902,"['Go', 'Java', 'Shell']","['filesystem', 'cloud-native', 'golang', 'redis', 'distributed-systems']","**JuiceFS** is a high-performance [POSIX]( file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage _(e.g. Amazon S3)_, and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements. With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage. **Document**: [Quick Start Guide]( ## Highlighted Features 1. **Fully POSIX-compatible**: Use as a local file system, seamlessly docking with existing applications without breaking business workflow. 2. **Fully Hadoop-compatible**: JuiceFS' [Hadoop Java SDK]( is compatible with Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x as well as a variety of components in the Hadoop ecosystems. 3. **S3-compatible**: JuiceFS' [S3 Gateway]( provides an S3-compatible interface. 4. **Cloud Native**: A [Kubernetes CSI Driver]( is provided for easily using JuiceFS in Kubernetes. 5. **Shareable**: JuiceFS is a shared file storage that can be read and written by thousands of clients. 6. **Strong Consistency**: The confirmed modification will be immediately visible on all the servers mounted with the same file system. 7. **Outstanding Performance**: The latency can be as low as a few milliseconds, and the throughput can be expanded nearly unlimitedly _(depending on the size of the Object Storage)_. [Test results]( 8. **Data Encryption**: Supports data encryption in transit and at rest (please refer to [the guide]( for more information). 9. **Global File Locks**: JuiceFS supports both BSD locks (flock) and POSIX record locks (fcntl). 10. **Data Compression**: JuiceFS supports [LZ4]( or [Zstandard]( to compress all your data. --- [Architecture](#architecture) | [Getting Started](#getting-started) | [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) | [POSIX Compatibility](#posix-compatibility) | [Performance Benchmark](#performance-benchmark) | [Supported Object Storage](#supported-object-storage) | [Who is using](#who-is-using) | [Roadmap](#roadmap) | [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues) | [Contributing](#contributing) | [Community](#community) | [Usage Tracking](#usage-tracking) | [License](#license) | [Credits](#credits) | [FAQ](#faq) --- ## Architecture JuiceFS consists of three parts: 1. **JuiceFS Client**: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway. 2. **Data Storage**: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS. 3. **Metadata Engine**: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV. JuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. [Learn more]( Each file stored in JuiceFS is split into **""Chunk""** s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more **""Slice""**(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed **""Block""** s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. [Learn more]( When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don't panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS! ## Getting Started Before you begin, make sure you have: 1. One supported metadata engine, see [How to Set Up Metadata Engine]( 2. One supported Object Storage for storing data blocks, see [Supported Object Storage]( 3. [JuiceFS Client]( downloaded and installed Please refer to [Quick Start Guide]( to start using JuiceFS right away! ### Command Reference Check out all the command line options in [command reference]( ### Containers JuiceFS can be used as a persistent volume for Docker and Podman, please check [here]( for details. ### Kubernetes It is also very easy to use JuiceFS on Kubernetes.

Only core metrics (e.g. version number) will be reported, and user data and any other sensitive data will not be included. The related code can be viewed [here](pkg/usage/usage.go). You could also disable reporting easily by command line option `--no-usage-report`: ```bash juicefs mount --no-usage-report ``` ## License JuiceFS is open-sourced under Apache License 2.0, see [LICENSE](LICENSE). ## Credits The design of JuiceFS was inspired by [Google File System]( [HDFS]( and [MooseFS]( Thanks for their great work! ## FAQ ### Why doesn't JuiceFS support XXX Object Storage? JuiceFS supports many Object Storage services. Please check out [this list]( first. If the Object Storage you want to use is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting any issue. ### Can I use Redis Cluster as metadata engine? Yes. Since [v1.0.0 Beta3]( JuiceFS supports the use of [Redis Cluster]( as the metadata engine, but it should be noted that Redis Cluster requires that the keys of all operations in a transaction must be in the same hash slot, so a JuiceFS file system can only use one hash slot. See [""Redis Best Practices""]( for more information. ### What's the difference between JuiceFS and XXX? See [""Comparison with Others""]( for more information.

node_exporter,prometheus/node_exporter,10432,"['Go', 'Shell', 'C']","['prometheus-exporter', 'prometheus', 'node-metrics', 'machine-metrics', 'host-metrics']","# Node exporter [][circleci] []( [][quay] [][hub] [][goreportcard] Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by \*NIX kernels, written in Go with pluggable metric collectors. The [Windows exporter]( is recommended for Windows users. To expose NVIDIA GPU metrics, [prometheus-dcgm ]( can be used. ## Installation and Usage If you are new to Prometheus and `node_exporter` there is a [simple step-by-step guide]( The `node_exporter` listens on HTTP port 9100 by default. See the `--help` output for more options. ### Ansible For automated installs with [Ansible]( there is the [Prometheus Community role]( ### Docker The `node_exporter` is designed to monitor the host system. Deploying in containers requires extra care in order to avoid monitoring the container itself. For situations where containerized deployment is needed, some extra flags must be used to allow the `node_exporter` access to the host namespaces. Be aware that any non-root mount points you want to monitor will need to be bind-mounted into the container. If you start container for host monitoring, specify `path.rootfs` argument. This argument must match path in bind-mount of host root. The node\_exporter will use `path.rootfs` as prefix to access host filesystem. ```bash docker run -d \ --net=""host"" \ --pid=""host"" \ -v ""/:/host:ro,rslave"" \ quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest \ --path.rootfs=/host ``` For Docker compose, similar flag changes are needed. ```yaml --- version: '3.8' services: node_exporter: image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest container_name: node_exporter command: - '--path.rootfs=/host' network_mode: host pid: host restart: unless-stopped volumes: - '/:/host:ro,rslave' ``` On some systems, the `timex` collector requires an additional Docker flag, `--cap-add=SYS_TIME`, in order to access the required syscalls. ## Collectors There is varying support for collectors on each operating system. The tables below list all existing collectors and the supported systems. Collectors are enabled by providing a `--collector.` flag. Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled by providing a `--no-collector.` flag. To enable only some specific collector(s), use `--collector.disable-defaults --collector. ...`. ### Include & Exclude flags A few collectors can be configured to include or exclude certain patterns using dedicated flags. The exclude flags are used to indicate ""all except"", while the include flags are used to say ""none except"". Note that these flags are mutually exclusive on collectors that support both. Example: ```txt --collector.filesystem.mount-points-exclude=^/(dev|proc|sys|var/lib/docker/.+|var/lib/kubelet/.+)($|/) ``` List: Collector | Scope | Include Flag | Exclude Flag --- | --- | --- | --- arp | device | --collector.arp.device-include | --collector.arp.device-exclude cpu | bugs | --collector.cpu.info.bugs-include | N/A cpu | flags | --collector.cpu.info.flags-include | N/A diskstats | device | --collector.diskstats.device-include | --collector.diskstats.device-exclude ethtool | device | --collector.ethtool.device-include | --collector.ethtool.device-exclude ethtool | metrics | --collector.ethtool.metrics-include | N/A filesystem | fs-types | N/A | --collector.filesystem.fs-types-exclude filesystem | mount-points | N/A | --collector.filesystem.mount-points-exclude hwmon | chip | --collector.hwmon.chip-include | --collector.hwmon.chip-exclude netdev | device | --collector.netdev.device-include | --collector.netdev.device-exclude qdisk | device | --collector.qdisk.device-include | --collector.qdisk.device-exclude sysctl | all | --collector.sysctl.include | N/A systemd | unit | --collector.systemd.unit-include | --collector.systemd.unit-exclude ### Enabled by default Name | Description | OS ---------|-------------|---- arp | Exposes ARP statistics from `/proc/net/arp`. | Linux bcache | Exposes bcache statistics from `/sys/fs/bcache/`. | Linux bonding | Exposes the number of configured and active slaves of Linux bonding interfaces. | Linux btrfs | Exposes btrfs statistics | Linux boottime | Exposes system boot time derived from the `kern.boottime` sysctl. | Darwin, Dragonfly, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris conntrack | Shows conntrack statistics (does nothing if no `/proc/sys/net/netfilter/` present). | Linux cpu | Exposes CPU statistics | Darwin, Dragonfly, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD cpufreq | Exposes CPU frequency statistics | Linux, Solaris diskstats | Exposes disk I/O statistics. | Darwin, Linux, OpenBSD dmi | Expose Desktop Management Interface (DMI) info from `/sys/class/dmi/id/` | Linux edac | Exposes error detection and correction statistics. | Linux entropy | Exposes available entropy. | Linux exec | Exposes execution statistics. | Dragonfly, FreeBSD fibrechannel | Exposes fibre channel information and statistics from `/sys/class/fc_host/`. | Linux filefd | Exposes file descriptor statistics from `/proc/sys/fs/file-nr`. | Linux filesystem | Exposes filesystem statistics, such as disk space used. | Darwin, Dragonfly, FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD hwmon | Expose hardware monitoring and sensor data from `/sys/class/hwmon/`. | Linux infiniband | Exposes network statistics specific to InfiniBand and Intel OmniPath configurations. | Linux ipvs | Exposes IPVS status from `/proc/net/ip_vs` and stats from `/proc/net/ip_vs_stats`. | Linux loadavg | Exposes load average. | Darwin, Dragonfly, FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris mdadm | Exposes statistics about devices in `/proc/mdstat` (does nothing if no `/proc/mdstat` present). | Linux meminfo | Exposes memory statistics. | Darwin, Dragonfly, FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD netclass | Exposes network interface info from `/sys/class/net/` | Linux netdev | Exposes network interface statistics such as bytes transferred. | Darwin, Dragonfly, FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD netisr | Exposes netisr statistics | FreeBSD netstat | Exposes network statistics from `/proc/net/netstat`.

Reasons for this vary by collector, and may include: * High cardinality * Prolonged runtime that exceeds the Prometheus `scrape_interval` or `scrape_timeout` * Significant resource demands on the host You can enable additional collectors as desired by adding them to your init system's or service supervisor's startup configuration for `node_exporter` but caution is advised. Enable at most one at a time, testing first on a non-production system, then by hand on a single production node. When enabling additional collectors, you should carefully monitor the change by observing the ` scrape_duration_seconds` metric to ensure that collection completes and does not time out. In addition, monitor the `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` metric to see the changes in cardinality.

Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? _Are you kidding me?_ To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? _Are you KIDDING me?!_ Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? _YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!_ If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you. ## Table of contents - [Sponsors](#sponsors) - [Elevator Pitch](#elevator-pitch) - [Table of contents](#table-of-contents) - [Features](#features) - [Stage individual lines](#stage-individual-lines) - [Interactive Rebase](#interactive-rebase) - [Cherry-pick](#cherry-pick) - [Bisect](#bisect) - [Nuke the working tree](#nuke-the-working-tree) - [Amend an old commit](#amend-an-old-commit) - [Filter](#filter) - [Invoke a custom command](#invoke-a-custom-command) - [Worktrees](#worktrees) - [Rebase magic (custom patches)](#rebase-magic-custom-patches) - [Rebase from marked base commit](#rebase-from-marked-base-commit) - [Undo](#undo) - [Commit graph](#commit-graph) - [Compare two commits](#compare-two-commits) - [Tutorials](#tutorials) - [Installation](#installation) - [Binary Releases](#binary-releases) - [Homebrew](#homebrew) - [MacPorts](#macports) - [Void Linux](#void-linux) - [Scoop (Windows)](#scoop-windows) - [Arch Linux](#arch-linux) - [Fedora and RHEL](#fedora-and-rhel) - [Solus Linux](#solus-linux) - [Ubuntu](#ubuntu) - [Funtoo Linux](#funtoo-linux) - [Gentoo Linux](#gentoo-linux) - [FreeBSD](#freebsd) - [Termux](#termux) - [Conda](#conda) - [Go](#go) - [Chocolatey (Windows)](#chocolatey-windows) - [Winget (Windows 10 1709 or later)](#winget-windows-10-1709-or-later) - [Manual](#manual) - [Usage](#usage) - [Keybindings](#keybindings) - [Changing Directory On Exit](#changing-directory-on-exit) - [Undo/Redo](#undoredo) - [Configuration](#configuration) - [Custom Pagers](#custom-pagers) - [Custom Commands](#custom-commands) - [Git flow support](#git-flow-support) - [Contributing](#contributing) - [Debugging Locally](#debugging-locally) - [Donate](#donate) - [FAQ](#faq) - [What do the commit colors represent?](#what-do-the-commit-colors-represent) - [Shameless Plug](#shameless-plug) - [Alternatives](#alternatives) Lazygit is not my fulltime job but it is a hefty part time job so if you want to support the project please consider [sponsoring me]( ## Features ### Stage individual lines Press space on the selected line to stage it, or press `v` to start selecting a range of lines. You can also press `a` to select the entirety of the current hunk. ### Interactive Rebase Press `i` to start an interactive rebase. Then squash (`s`), fixup (`f`), drop (`d`), edit (`e`), move up (`ctrl+i`) or move down (`ctrl+j`) any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with `m` and then selecting `continue`. You can also perform any these actions as a once-off (e.g. pressing `s` on a commit to squash it) without explicitly starting a rebase. This demo also uses shift+down to select a range of commits to move and fixup. ### Cherry-pick Press `shift+c` on a commit to copy it and press `shift+v` to paste (cherry-pick) it. ### Bisect Press `b` in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect. ### Nuke the working tree For when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run `git status` (and yes that includes dirty submodules) [kidpix style]( press `shift+d` to bring up the reset options menu and then select the 'nuke' option. ### Amend an old commit Pressing `shift+a` on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes (running an interactive rebase in the background). ### Filter You can filter a view with `/`. Here we filter down our branches view and then hit `enter` to view its commits. ### Invoke a custom command Lazygit has a very flexible [custom command system](docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md). In this example a custom command is defined which emulates the built-in branch checkout action. ### Worktrees You can create worktrees to have multiple branches going at once without the need for stashing or creating WIP commits when switching between them. Press `w` in the branches view to create a worktree from the selected branch and switch to it. ### Rebase magic (custom patches) You can build a custom patch from an old commit and then remove the patch from the commit, split out a new commit, apply the patch in reverse to the index, and more. In this example we have a redundant comment that we want to remove from an old commit. We hit `` on the commit to view its files, then `` on a file to focus the patch, then `` to add the comment line to our custom patch, and then `ctrl+p` to view the custom patch options; selecting to remove the patch from the current commit. Learn more in the [Rebase magic Youtube tutorial]( ### Rebase from marked base commit Say you're on a feature branch that was itself branched off of the develop branch, and you've decided you'd rather be branching off the master branch. You need a way to rebase only the commits from your feature branch. In this demo we check to see which was the last commit on the develop branch, then press `shift+b` to mark that commit as our base commit, then press `r` on the master branch to rebase onto it, only bringing across the commits from our feature branch. Then we push our changes with `shift+p`. ### Undo You can undo the last action by pressing 'z' and redo with `ctrl+z`. Here we drop a couple of commits and then undo the actions. Undo uses the reflog which is specific to commits and branches so we can't undo changes to the working tree or stash. [More info](/docs/Undoing.md) ### Commit graph When viewing the commit graph in an enlarged window (use `+` and `_` to cycle window sizes), the commit graph is shown. Colours correspond to the commit authors, and as you navigate down the graph, the parent commits of the selected commit are highlighted. ### Compare two commits If you press `shift+w` on a commit (or branch/ref) a menu will open that allows you to mark that commit so that any other commit you select will be diffed against it. Once you've selected the second commit, you'll see the diff in the main view and if you press `` you'll see the files of the diff. You can press `shift+w` to view the diff menu again to see options like reversing the diff direction or exiting diff mode. You can also exit diff mode by pressing ``. ## Tutorials []( - [15 Lazygit Features in 15 Minutes]( - [Basics Tutorial]( - [Rebase Magic Tutorial]( ## Installation []( _Most of the above packages are maintained by third parties so be sure to vet them yourself and confirm that the maintainer is a trustworthy looking person who attends local sports games and gives back to their communities with barbeque fundraisers etc_ ### Binary Releases For Windows, Mac OS(10.12+) or Linux, you can download a binary release [here](../../releases). ### Homebrew Normally the lazygit formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you tap our formula to get the frequently updated one.

cloudnative-pg,cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg,3555,"['Go', 'Shell', 'Makefile']","['postgres', 'postgresql', 'kubernetes', 'k8s', 'database']","[]( [][latest-release] [][license] [![Documentation][documentation-badge]][documentation] [][stackoverflow] # Welcome to the CloudNativePG project! **CloudNativePG** is a comprehensive open source platform designed to seamlessly manage [PostgreSQL]( databases within Kubernetes environments, covering the entire operational lifecycle from initial deployment to ongoing maintenance. The main component is the CloudNativePG operator. CloudNativePG was originally built and sponsored by [EDB]( ## Table of content - [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - [Governance policies]( - [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) - [Adopters](ADOPTERS.md) - [License](LICENSE) ## Getting Started The best way to get started is with the [""Quickstart""](docs/src/quickstart.md) section in the documentation. ## Scope The goal of CloudNativePG is to increase the adoption of PostgreSQL, one of the most loved DBMS in traditional VM and bare metal environments, inside Kubernetes, thus making the database an integral part of the development process and GitOps CI/CD automated pipelines. ### In scope CloudNativePG has been designed by Postgres experts with Kubernetes administrators in mind. Put simply, it leverages Kubernetes by extending its controller and by defining, in a programmatic way, all the actions that a good DBA would normally do when managing a highly available PostgreSQL database cluster. Since the inception, our philosophy has been to adopt a Kubernetes native approach to PostgreSQL cluster management, making incremental decisions that would answer the fundamental question: ""What would a Kubernetes user expect from a Postgres operator?"". The most important decision we made is to have the status of a PostgreSQL cluster directly available in the `Cluster` resource, so to inspect it through the Kubernetes API. We've fully embraced the operator pattern and eventual consistency, two of the core principles upon which Kubernetes is built for managing complex applications. As a result, the operator is responsible for managing the status of the `Cluster` resource, keeping it up to date with the information that each PostgreSQL instance manager regularly reports back through the API server. Changes to the cluster status might trigger, for example, actions like: * a PostgreSQL failover where, after an unexpected failure of a cluster's primary instance, the operator itself elects the new primary, updates the status, and directly coordinates the operation through the reconciliation loop, by relying on the instance managers * scaling up or down the number of read-only replicas, based on a positive or negative variation in the number of desired instances in the cluster, so that the operator creates or removes the required resources to run PostgreSQL, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, pods, secrets, config maps, and then coordinates cloning and streaming replication tasks * updates of the endpoints of the PostgreSQL services that applications rely on to interact with the database, as Kubernetes represents the single source of truth and authority * updates of container images in a rolling fashion, following a change in the image name, by first updating the pods where replicas are running, and then the primary, issuing a switchover first The latter example is based on another pillar of CloudNativePG: immutable application containers - as explained in the [blog article ""Why EDB Chose Immutable Application Containers""]( The above list can be extended. However, the gist is that CloudNativePG exclusively relies on the Kubernetes API server and the instance manager to coordinate the complex operations that need to take place in a business continuity PostgreSQL cluster, without requiring any assistance from an intermediate management tool responsible for high availability and failover management like similar open source operators. CloudNativePG also manages additional resources to help the `Cluster` resource manage PostgreSQL - currently `Backup`, `ClusterImageCatalog`, `ImageCatalog`, `Pooler`, and `ScheduledBackup`. Fully embracing Kubernetes means adopting a hands-off approach during temporary failures of the Kubernetes API server. In such instances, the operator refrains from taking action, deferring decisions until the API server is operational again. Meanwhile, Postgres instances persist, maintaining operations based on the latest known state of the cluster. ### Out of scope CloudNativePG is exclusively focused on the PostgreSQL database management system maintained by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG). We are not currently considering adding to CloudNativePG extensions or capabilities that are included in forks of the PostgreSQL database management system, unless in the form of extensible or pluggable frameworks. CloudNativePG doesn't intend to pursue database independence (e.g. control a MariaDB cluster). ## Communications - [Slack Channel]( - [Github Discussions]( - [Twitter]( ## Resources - [Roadmap]( - [Website]( - [FAQ](docs/src/faq.md) - [Blog]( ## Adopters A list of publicly known users of the CloudNativePG operator is in [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md).

For more installation options, see [README-VIM.md](README-VIM.md). Upgrading fzf ------------- fzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a while. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation method used. - git: `cd ~/.fzf && git pull && ./install` - brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf` - macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf` - chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf` - vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf` Building fzf ------------ See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md). Usage ----- fzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the selected item to STDOUT. ```sh find * -type f | fzf > selected ``` Without STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current directory to get the list of files. ```sh vim $(fzf) ``` > [!NOTE] > You can override the default behavior > * Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list > * Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` > [!WARNING] > A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we've presented > the above as it's easier to grasp > ```sh > fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim > ``` > [!TIP] > fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process. > > ```sh > fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})' > ``` > > *See [Turning into a different process](#turning-into-a-different-process) > for more information.* ### Using the finder - `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down - `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit - On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items - Emacs style key bindings - Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on multi-select mode ### Layout fzf by default starts in fullscreen mode, but you can make it start below the cursor with `--height` option. ```sh vim $(fzf --height 40%) ``` Also, check out `--reverse` and `--layout` options if you prefer ""top-down"" layout instead of the default ""bottom-up"" layout. ```sh vim $(fzf --height 40% --reverse) ``` You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they're applied by default. For example, ```sh export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --layout=reverse --border' ``` ### Search syntax Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in ""extended-search mode"" where you can type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !fire` | Token | Match type | Description | | --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | | `sbtrkt` | fuzzy-match | Items that match `sbtrkt` | | `'wild` | exact-match (quoted) | Items that include `wild` | | `^music` | prefix-exact-match | Items that start with `music` | | `.mp3$` | suffix-exact-match | Items that end with `.mp3` | | `!fire` | inverse-exact-match | Items that do not include `fire` | | `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match | Items that do not start with `music` | | `!.mp3$` | inverse-suffix-exact-match | Items that do not end with `.mp3` | If you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to ""quote"" every word, start fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when `--exact` is set, `'`-prefix ""unquotes"" the term. A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query match...

Why would you want to do this? Two reasons: - **Fast Feedback** - Rather than having to commit/push every time you want to test out the changes you are making to your `.github/workflows/` files (or for any changes to embedded GitHub actions), you can use `act` to run the actions locally. The [environment variables]( and [filesystem]( are all configured to match what GitHub provides. - **Local Task Runner** - I love [make](). However, I also hate repeating myself. With `act`, you can use the GitHub Actions defined in your `.github/workflows/` to replace your `Makefile`! # How Does It Work? When you run `act` it reads in your GitHub Actions from `.github/workflows/` and determines the set of actions that need to be run. It uses the Docker API to either pull or build the necessary images, as defined in your workflow files and finally determines the execution path based on the dependencies that were defined. Once it has the execution path, it then uses the Docker API to run containers for each action based on the images prepared earlier. The [environment variables]( and [filesystem]( are all configured to match what GitHub provides. Let's see it in action with a [sample repo]( # Act User Guide Please look at the [act user guide]( for more documentation. # Support Need help?

karmada,karmada-io/karmada,4175,"['Go', 'Shell', 'Smarty']","['cloud-native', 'kubernetes', 'multicloud', 'cloud-computing', 'containers']","# Karmada [](/LICENSE) []( []( []( []( []( ## Karmada: Open, Multi-Cloud, Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Orchestration Karmada (Kubernetes Armada) is a Kubernetes management system that enables you to run your cloud-native applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds, with no changes to your applications. By speaking Kubernetes-native APIs and providing advanced scheduling capabilities, Karmada enables truly open, multi-cloud Kubernetes. Karmada aims to provide turnkey automation for multi-cluster application management in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud scenarios, with key features such as centralized multi-cloud management, high availability, failure recovery, and traffic scheduling. Karmada is an incubation project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]( (CNCF). ## Why Karmada: - __K8s Native API Compatible__ - Zero change upgrade, from single-cluster to multi-cluster - Seamless integration of existing K8s tool chain - __Out of the Box__ - Built-in policy sets for scenarios, including: Active-active, Remote DR, Geo Redundant, etc. - Cross-cluster applications auto-scaling, failover and load-balancing on multi-cluster. - __Avoid Vendor Lock-in__ - Integration with mainstream cloud providers - Automatic allocation, migration across clusters - Not tied to proprietary vendor orchestration - __Centralized Management__ - Location agnostic cluster management - Support clusters in Public cloud, on-prem or edge - __Fruitful Multi-Cluster Scheduling Policies__ - Cluster Affinity, Multi Cluster Splitting/Rebalancing - Multi-Dimension HA: Region/AZ/Cluster/Provider - __Open and Neutral__ - Jointly initiated by Internet, finance, manufacturing, teleco, cloud providers, etc. - Target for open governance with CNCF **Notice: this project is developed in continuation of Kubernetes [Federation v1]( and [v2]( Some basic concepts are inherited from these two versions.** ## Architecture The Karmada Control Plane consists of the following components: - Karmada API Server - Karmada Controller Manager - Karmada Scheduler ETCD stores the Karmada API objects, the API Server is the REST endpoint all other components talk to, and the Karmada Controller Manager performs operations based on the API objects you create through the API server. The Karmada Controller Manager runs the various controllers, the controllers watch Karmada objects and then talk to the underlying clusters' API servers to create regular Kubernetes resources. 1. Cluster Controller: attach Kubernetes clusters to Karmada for managing the lifecycle of the clusters by creating cluster objects. 2. Policy Controller: the controller watches PropagationPolicy objects. When the PropagationPolicy object is added, it selects a group of resources matching the resourceSelector and creates ResourceBinding with each single resource object. 3. Binding Controller: the controller watches ResourceBinding object and create Work object corresponding to each cluster with a single resource manifest. 4. Execution Controller: the controller watches Work objects. When Work objects are created, it will distribute the resources to member clusters. ## Concepts **Resource template**: Karmada uses Kubernetes Native API definition for federated resource template, to make it easy to integrate with existing tools that already adopt on Kubernetes **Propagation Policy**: Karmada offers a standalone Propagation(placement) Policy API to define multi-cluster scheduling and spreading requirements. - Support 1:n mapping of Policy: workload, users don't need to indicate scheduling constraints every time creating federated applications. - With default policies, users can just interact with K8s API **Override Policy**: Karmada provides standalone Override Policy API for specializing cluster relevant configuration automation. E.g.: - Override image prefix according to member cluster region - Override StorageClass according to cloud provider The following diagram shows how Karmada resources are involved when propagating resources to member clusters. ## Quick Start This guide will cover: - Install `karmada` control plane components in a Kubernetes cluster which is known as `host cluster`. - Join a member cluster to `karmada` control plane. - Propagate an application by using `karmada`. ### Prerequisites - [Go]( version v1.21+ - [kubectl]( version v1.19+ - [kind]( version v0.14.0+ ### Install the Karmada control plane #### 1. Clone this repo to your machine: ```bash git clone ``` #### 2. Change to the karmada directory: ```bash cd karmada ``` #### 3. Deploy and run Karmada control plane: run the following script: ```bash hack/local-up-karmada.sh ``` This script will do the following tasks for you: - Start a Kubernetes cluster to run the Karmada control plane, aka. the `host cluster`. - Build Karmada control plane components based on a current codebase. - Deploy Karmada control plane components on the `host cluster`. - Create member clusters and join Karmada. If everything goes well, at the end of the script output, you will see similar messages as follows: ```bash Local Karmada is running. To start using your Karmada environment, run: export KUBECONFIG=""$HOME/.kube/karmada.config"" Please use 'kubectl config use-context karmada-host/karmada-apiserver' to switch the host and control plane cluster. To manage your member clusters, run: export KUBECONFIG=""$HOME/.kube/members.config"" Please use 'kubectl config use-context member1/member2/member3' to switch to the different member cluster. ``` There are two contexts in Karmada: - karmada-apiserver `kubectl config use-context karmada-apiserver` - karmada-host `kubectl config use-context karmada-host` The `karmada-apiserver` is the **main kubeconfig** to be used when interacting with the Karmada control plane, while `karmada-host` is only used for debugging Karmada installation with the host cluster. You can check all clusters at any time by running: `kubectl config view`. To switch cluster contexts, run `kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT_NAME]` ### Demo ### Propagate application In the following steps, we are going to propagate a deployment by Karmada. #### 1. Create nginx deployment in Karmada. First, create a [deployment](samples/nginx/deployment.yaml) named `nginx`: ```bash kubectl create -f samples/nginx/deployment.yaml ``` #### 2. Create PropagationPolicy that will propagate nginx to member cluster Then, we need to create a policy to propagate the deployment to our member cluster. ```bash kubectl create -f samples/nginx/propagationpolicy.yaml ``` #### 3. Check the deployment status from Karmada You can check deployment status from Karmada, don't need to access member cluster: ```bash $ kubectl get deployment NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE nginx 2/2 2 2 20s ``` ## Kubernetes compatibility | | Kubernetes 1.16 | Kubernetes 1.17 | Kubernetes 1.18 | Kubernetes 1.19 | Kubernetes 1.20 | Kubernetes 1.21 | Kubernetes 1.22 | Kubernetes 1.23 | Kubernetes 1.24 | Kubernetes 1.25 | Kubernetes 1.26 | Kubernetes 1.27 | Kubernetes 1.28 | Kubernetes 1.29 | |-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------| | Karmada v1.7 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Karmada v1.8 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Karmada v1.9 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Karmada HEAD (master) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Key: * `` Karmada and the Kubernetes version are exactly compatible. * `+` Karmada has features or API objects that may not be present in the Kubernetes version. * `-` The Kubernetes version has features or API objects that Karmada can't use. ## Meeting Regular Community Meeting: * Tuesday at 14:30 UTC+8 (Chinese)(biweekly).

BuildKit is composed of the `buildkitd` daemon and the `buildctl` client. While the `buildctl` client is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, the `buildkitd` daemon is only available for Linux and *Windows currently. The latest binaries of BuildKit are available [here]( for Linux, macOS, and Windows. ### Linux Setup The `buildkitd` daemon requires the following components to be installed: - [runc]( or [crun]( - [containerd]( (if you want to use containerd worker) **Starting the `buildkitd` daemon:** You need to run `buildkitd` as the root user on the host. ```bash $ sudo buildkitd ``` To run `buildkitd` as a non-root user, see [`docs/rootless.md`](docs/rootless.md). The buildkitd daemon supports two worker backends: OCI (runc) and containerd. By default, the OCI (runc) worker is used. You can set `--oci-worker=false --containerd-worker=true` to use the containerd worker. We are open to adding more backends. To start the buildkitd daemon using systemd socket activation, you can install the buildkit systemd unit files. See [Systemd socket activation](#systemd-socket-activation) The buildkitd daemon listens gRPC API on `/run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock` by default, but you can also use TCP sockets. See [Expose BuildKit as a TCP service](#expose-buildkit-as-a-tcp-service). ### Windows Setup See instructions and notes at [`docs/windows.md`](./docs/windows.md). ### macOS Setup [Homebrew formula]( (unofficial) is available for macOS. ```console $ brew install buildkit ``` The Homebrew formula does not contain the daemon (`buildkitd`). For example, [Lima]( can be used for launching the daemon inside a Linux VM. ```console brew install lima limactl start template://buildkit export BUILDKIT_HOST=""unix://$HOME/.lima/buildkit/sock/buildkitd.sock"" ``` ### Build from source To build BuildKit from source, see [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). For a `buildctl` reference, see [this document](./docs/reference/buildctl.md). ### Exploring LLB BuildKit builds are based on a binary intermediate format called LLB that is used for defining the dependency graph for processes running part of your build. tl;dr: LLB is to Dockerfile what LLVM IR is to C. - Marshaled as Protobuf messages - Concurrently executable - Efficiently cacheable - Vendor-neutral (i.e. non-Dockerfile languages can be easily implemented) See [`solver/pb/ops.proto`](./solver/pb/ops.proto) for the format definition, and see [`./examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md) for example LLB applications. Currently, the following high-level languages have been implemented for LLB: - Dockerfile (See [Exploring Dockerfiles](#exploring-dockerfiles)) - [Buildpacks]( - [Mockerfile]( - [Gockerfile]( - [bldr (Pkgfile)]( - [HLB]( - [Earthfile (Earthly)]( - [Cargo Wharf (Rust)]( - [Nix]( - [mopy (Python)]( - [envd (starlark)]( - [Blubber]( - [Bass]( - [kraft.yaml (Unikraft)]( - (open a PR to add your own language) ### Exploring Dockerfiles Frontends are components that run inside BuildKit and convert any build definition to LLB. There is a special frontend called gateway (`gateway.v0`) that allows using any image as a frontend. During development, Dockerfile frontend (`dockerfile.v0`) is also part of the BuildKit repo. In the future, this will be moved out, and Dockerfiles can be built using an external image. #### Building a Dockerfile with `buildctl` ```bash buildctl build \ --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \ --local context=. \ --local dockerfile=. # or buildctl build \ --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \ --local context=. \ --local dockerfile=. \ --opt target=foo \ --opt build-arg:foo=bar ``` `--local` exposes local source files from client to the builder. `context` and `dockerfile` are the names Dockerfile frontend looks for build context and Dockerfile location. If the Dockerfile has a different filename it can be specified with `--opt filename=./Dockerfile-alternative`. #### Building a Dockerfile using external frontend External versions of the Dockerfile frontend are pushed to and and can be used with the gateway frontend. The source for the external frontend is currently located in `./frontend/dockerfile/cmd/dockerfile-frontend` but will move out of this repository in the future ([#163]( For automatic build from master branch of this repository `docker/dockerfile-upstream:master` or `docker/dockerfile-upstream:master-labs` image can be used. ```bash buildctl build \ --frontend gateway.v0 \ --opt source=docker/dockerfile \ --local context=. \ --local dockerfile=. buildctl build \ --frontend gateway.v0 \ --opt source=docker/dockerfile \ --opt context= \ --opt build-arg:APT_MIRROR=cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org ``` ### Output By default, the build result and intermediate cache will only remain internally in BuildKit. An output needs to be specified to retrieve the result. #### Image/Registry ```bash buildctl build ... --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true ``` To export the image to multiple registries: ```bash buildctl build ... --output type=image,\""name=docker.io/username/image,docker.io/username2/image2\"",push=true ``` To export the cache embed with the image and pushing them to registry together, type `registry` is required to import the cache, you should specify `--export-cache type=inline` and `--import-cache type=registry,ref=...`. To export the cache to a local directly, you should specify `--export-cache type=local`. Details in [Export cache](#export-cache). ```bash buildctl build ...\ --output type=image,name=docker.io/username/image,push=true \ --export-cache type=inline \ --import-cache type=registry,ref=docker.io/username/image ``` Keys supported by image output: * `name=`: specify image name(s) * `push=true`: push after creating the image * `push-by-digest=true`: push unnamed image * `registry.insecure=true`: push to insecure HTTP registry * `oci-mediatypes=true`: use OCI mediatypes in configuration JSON instead of Docker's * `unpack=true`: unpack image after creation (for use with containerd) * `dangling-name-prefix=`: name image with `prefix@`, used for anonymous images * `name-canonical=true`: add additional canonical name `name@` * `compression=`: choose compression type for layers newly created and cached, gzip is default value. estargz should be used with `oci-mediatypes=true`. * `compression-level=`: compression level for gzip, estargz (0-9) and zstd (0-22) * `rewrite-timestamp=true`: rewrite the file timestamps to the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` value.

See [features available in enterprise package]( Enterprise binaries can be downloaded and evaluated for free from [the releases page]( You can also [request a free trial license]( VictoriaMetrics is developed at a fast pace, so it is recommended to check the [CHANGELOG]( periodically, and to perform [regular upgrades](#how-to-upgrade-victoriametrics). [VictoriaMetrics enterprise]( provides long-term support lines of releases (LTS releases) - see [these docs]( VictoriaMetrics has achieved security certifications for Database Software Development and Software-Based Monitoring Services. We apply strict security measures in everything we do. See [Security page]( for more details. ## Prominent features VictoriaMetrics has the following prominent features: * It can be used as long-term storage for Prometheus. See [these docs](#prometheus-setup) for details. * It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus in Grafana, because it supports the [Prometheus querying API](#prometheus-querying-api-usage). * It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Graphite in Grafana, because it supports the [Graphite API](#graphite-api-usage). VictoriaMetrics allows reducing infrastructure costs by more than 10x comparing to Graphite - see [this case study]( * It is easy to setup and operate: * VictoriaMetrics consists of a single [small executable]( without external dependencies. * All the configuration is done via explicit command-line flags with reasonable defaults. * All the data is stored in a single directory specified by the `-storageDataPath` command-line flag. * Easy and fast backups from [instant snapshots]( can be done with [vmbackup]( / [vmrestore]( tools. See [this article]( for more details. * It implements a PromQL-like query language - [MetricsQL]( which provides improved functionality on top of PromQL. * It provides a global query view. Multiple Prometheus instances or any other data sources may ingest data into VictoriaMetrics. Later this data may be queried via a single query. * It provides high performance and good vertical and horizontal scalability for both [data ingestion]( and [data querying]( It [outperforms InfluxDB and TimescaleDB by up to 20x]( * It [uses 10x less RAM than InfluxDB]( and [up to 7x less RAM than Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex]( when dealing with millions of unique time series (aka [high cardinality]( * It is optimized for time series with [high churn rate]( * It provides high data compression: up to 70x more data points may be stored into limited storage compared with TimescaleDB according to [these benchmarks]( and up to 7x less storage space is required compared to Prometheus, Thanos or Cortex. according to [this benchmark]( * It is optimized for storage with high-latency IO and low IOPS (HDD and network storage in AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc). See [disk IO graphs from these benchmarks]( * A single-node VictoriaMetrics may substitute moderately sized clusters built with competing solutions such as Thanos, M3DB, Cortex, InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. See [vertical scalability benchmarks]( [comparing Thanos to VictoriaMetrics cluster]( and [Remote Write Storage Wars]( talk from [PromCon 2019]( * It protects the storage from data corruption on unclean shutdown (i.e. OOM, hardware reset or `kill -9`) thanks to [the storage architecture]( * It supports metrics scraping, ingestion and [backfilling](#backfilling) via the following protocols: * [Metrics scraping from Prometheus exporters](#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter). * [Prometheus remote write API](#prometheus-setup). * [Prometheus exposition format](#how-to-import-data-in-prometheus-exposition-format). * [InfluxDB line protocol](#how-to-send-data-from-influxdb-compatible-agents-such-as-telegraf) over HTTP, TCP and UDP. * [Graphite plaintext protocol](#how-to-send-data-from-graphite-compatible-agents-such-as-statsd) with [tags]( * [Statsd plaintext protocol](#how-to-send-data-from-statsd-compatible-clients) * [OpenTSDB put message](#sending-data-via-telnet-put-protocol). * [HTTP OpenTSDB /api/put requests](#sending-opentsdb-data-via- * [JSON line format](#how-to-import-data-in-json-line-format). * [Arbitrary CSV data](#how-to-import-csv-data). * [Native binary format](#how-to-import-data-in-native-format). * [DataDog agent or DogStatsD](#how-to-send-data-from-datadog-agent). * [NewRelic infrastructure agent](#how-to-send-data-from-newrelic-agent). * [OpenTelemetry metrics format](#sending-data-via-opentelemetry). * It supports powerful [stream aggregation]( which can be used as a [statsd]( alternative. * It supports metrics [relabeling](#relabeling). * It can deal with [high cardinality issues]( and [high churn rate]( issues via [series limiter](#cardinality-limiter). * It ideally works with big amounts of time series data from APM, Kubernetes, IoT sensors, connected cars, industrial telemetry, financial data and various [Enterprise workloads]( * It has an open source [cluster version]( * It can store data on [NFS-based storages]( such as [Amazon EFS]( and [Google Filestore]( See [case studies for VictoriaMetrics]( and [various Articles about VictoriaMetrics]( ## Components VictoriaMetrics ecosystem contains the following components additionally to [single-node VictoriaMetrics]( - [vmagent]( - lightweight agent for receiving metrics via [pull-based]( and [push-based]( protocols, transforming and sending them to the configured Prometheus-compatible remote storage systems such as VictoriaMetrics. - [vmalert]( - a service for processing Prometheus-compatible alerting and recording rules. - [vmalert-tool]( - a tool for validating alerting and recording rules. - [vmauth]( - authorization proxy and load balancer optimized for VictoriaMetrics products. - [vmgateway]( - authorization proxy with per-[tenant]( rate limiting cababilities. - [vmctl]( - a tool for migrating and copying data between different storage systems for metrics. - [vmbackup]( [vmrestore]( and [vmbackupmanager]( - tools for creating backups and restoring from backups for VictoriaMetrics data. - `vminsert`, `vmselect` and `vmstorage` - components of [VictoriaMetrics cluster]( - [VictoriaLogs]( - user-friendly cost-efficient database for logs. ## Operation ### Install To quickly try VictoriaMetrics, just download the [VictoriaMetrics executable]( or [Docker image]( and start it with the desired command-line flags. See also [QuickStart guide]( for additional information. VictoriaMetrics can also be installed via these installation methods: * [Helm charts for single-node and cluster versions of VictoriaMetrics]( * [Kubernetes operator for VictoriaMetrics]( * [Ansible role for installing cluster VictoriaMetrics (by VictoriaMetrics)]( * [Ansible role for installing cluster VictoriaMetrics (by community)]( * [Ansible role for installing single-node VictoriaMetrics (by community)]( * [Snap package for VictoriaMetrics]( ### How to start VictoriaMetrics The following command-line flags are used the most: * `-storageDataPath` - VictoriaMetrics stores all the data in this directory. The default path is `victoria-metrics-data` in the current working directory. * `-retentionPeriod` - retention for stored data. Older data is automatically deleted. Default retention is 1 month (31 days). The minimum retention period is 24h or 1d. See [these docs](#retention) for more details. Other flags have good enough default values, so set them only if you really need to. Pass `-help` to see [all the available flags with description and default values](#list-of-command-line-flags). The following docs may be useful during initial VictoriaMetrics setup: * [How to set up scraping of Prometheus-compatible targets]( * [How to ingest data to VictoriaMetrics](#how-to-import-time-series-data) * [How to set up Prometheus to write data to VictoriaMetrics]( * [How to query VictoriaMetrics via Grafana](#grafana-setup) * [How to query VictoriaMetrics via Graphite API](#graphite-api-usage) * [How to handle alerts](#alerting) VictoriaMetrics accepts [Prometheus querying API requests](#prometheus-querying-api-usage) on port `8428` by default. It is recommended setting up [monitoring](#monitoring) for VictoriaMetrics. ### Environment variables All the VictoriaMetrics components allow referring environment variables in `yaml` configuration files (such as `-promscrape.config`) and in command-line flags via `%{ENV_VAR}` syntax. For example, `-metricsAuthKey=%{METRICS_AUTH_KEY}` is automatically expanded to `-metricsAuthKey=top-secret` if `METRICS_AUTH_KEY=top-secret` environment variable exists at VictoriaMetrics startup. This expansion is performed by VictoriaMetrics itself. VictoriaMetrics recursively expands `%{ENV_VAR}` references in environment variables on startup. For example, `FOO=%{BAR}` environment variable is expanded to `FOO=abc` if `BAR=a%{BAZ}` and `BAZ=bc`. Additionally, all the VictoriaMetrics components allow setting flag values via environment variables according to these rules: * The `-envflag.enable` flag must be set. * Each `.` char in flag name must be substituted with `_` (for example `-insert.maxQueueDuration ` will translate to `insert_maxQueueDuration=`). * For repeating flags an alternative syntax can be used by joining the different values...

containerd,containerd/containerd,16487,"['Go', 'Shell', 'Makefile']","['containerd', 'oci', 'containers', 'docker', 'cncf']","[]( []( []( []( []( []( containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc. containerd is a member of CNCF with ['graduated']( status. containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being used directly by developers or end-users. ## Announcements ### Now Recruiting We are a large inclusive OSS project that is welcoming help of any kind shape or form: * Documentation help is needed to make the product easier to consume and extend. * We need OSS community outreach/organizing help to get the word out; manage and create messaging and educational content; and help with social media, community forums/groups, and google groups. * We are actively inviting new [security advisors]( to join the team. * New subprojects are being created, core and non-core that could use additional development help. * Each of the [containerd projects]( has a list of issues currently being worked on or that need help resolving. - If the issue has not already been assigned to someone or has not made recent progress, and you are interested, please inquire. - If you are interested in starting with a smaller/beginner-level issue, look for issues with an `exp/beginner` tag, for example [containerd/containerd beginner issues.]( ## Getting Started See our documentation on [containerd.io]( * [for ops and admins](docs/ops.md) * [namespaces](docs/namespaces.md) * [client options](docs/client-opts.md) To get started contributing to containerd, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you are interested in trying out containerd see our example at [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md). ## Nightly builds There are nightly builds available for download [here]( Binaries are generated from `main` branch every night for `Linux` and `Windows`. Please be aware: nightly builds might have critical bugs, it's not recommended for use in production and no support provided. ## Kubernetes (k8s) CI Dashboard Group The [k8s CI dashboard group for containerd]( contains test results regarding the health of kubernetes when run against main and a number of containerd release branches. - [containerd-periodics]( ## Runtime Requirements Runtime requirements for containerd are very minimal. Most interactions with the Linux and Windows container feature sets are handled via [runc]( and/or OS-specific libraries (e.g. [hcsshim]( for Microsoft). The current required version of `runc` is described in [RUNC.md](docs/RUNC.md). There are specific features used by containerd core code and snapshotters that will require a minimum kernel version on Linux. With the understood caveat of distro kernel versioning, a reasonable starting point for Linux is a minimum 4.x kernel version. The overlay filesystem snapshotter, used by default, uses features that were finalized in the 4.x kernel series. If you choose to use btrfs, there may be more flexibility in kernel version (minimum recommended is 3.18), but will require the btrfs kernel module and btrfs tools to be installed on your Linux distribution. To use Linux checkpoint and restore features, you will need `criu` installed on your system. See more details in [Checkpoint and Restore](#checkpoint-and-restore). Build requirements for developers are listed in [BUILDING](BUILDING.md). ## Supported Registries Any registry which is compliant with the [OCI Distribution Specification]( is supported by containerd. For configuring registries, see [registry host configuration documentation](docs/hosts.md) ## Features ### Client containerd offers a full client package to help you integrate containerd into your platform. ```go import ( ""context"" containerd ""github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/client"" ""github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/pkg/cio"" ""github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/pkg/namespaces"" ) func main() { client, err := containerd.New(""/run/containerd/containerd.sock"") defer client.Close() } ``` ### Namespaces Namespaces allow multiple consumers to use the same containerd without conflicting with each other. It has the benefit of sharing content while maintaining separation with containers and images. To set a namespace for requests to the API: ```go context = context.Background() // create a context for docker docker = namespaces.WithNamespace(context, ""docker"") containerd, err := client.NewContainer(docker, ""id"") ``` To set a default namespace on the client: ```go client, err := containerd.New(address, containerd.WithDefaultNamespace(""docker"")) ``` ### Distribution ```go // pull an image image, err := client.Pull(context, ""docker.io/library/redis:latest"") // push an image err := client.Push(context, ""docker.io/library/redis:latest"", image.Target()) ``` ### Containers In containerd, a container is a metadata object. Resources such as an OCI runtime specification, image, root filesystem, and other metadata can be attached to a container. ```go redis, err := client.NewContainer(context, ""redis-master"") defer redis.Delete(context) ``` ### OCI Runtime Specification containerd fully supports the OCI runtime specification for running containers. We have built-in functions to help you generate runtime specifications based on images as well as custom parameters. You can specify options when creating a container about how to modify the specification. ```go redis, err := client.NewContainer(context, ""redis-master"", containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image))) ``` ### Root Filesystems containerd allows you to use overlay or snapshot filesystems with your containers. It comes with built-in support for overlayfs and btrfs. ```go // pull an image and unpack it into the configured snapshotter image, err := client.Pull(context, ""docker.io/library/redis:latest"", containerd.WithPullUnpack) // allocate a new RW root filesystem for a container based on the image redis, err := client.NewContainer(context, ""redis-master"", containerd.WithNewSnapshot(""redis-rootfs"", image), containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)), ) // use a readonly filesystem with multiple containers for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { id := fmt.Sprintf(""id-%s"", i) container, err := client.NewContainer(ctx, id, containerd.WithNewSnapshotView(id, image), containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)), ) } ``` ### Tasks Taking a container object and turning it into a runnable process on a system is done by creating a new `Task` from the container. A task represents the runnable object within containerd. ```go // create a new task task, err := redis.NewTask(context, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio)) defer task.Delete(context) // the task is now running and has a pid that can be used to setup networking // or other runtime settings outside of containerd pid := task.Pid() // start the redis-server process inside the container err := task.Start(context) // wait for the task to exit and get the exit status status, err := task.Wait(context) ``` ### Checkpoint and Restore If you have [criu]( installed on your machine you can checkpoint and restore containers and their tasks. This allows you to clone and/or live migrate containers to other machines. ```go // checkpoint the task then push it to a registry checkpoint, err := task.Checkpoint(context) err := client.Push(context, ""myregistry/checkpoints/redis:master"", checkpoint) // on a new machine pull the checkpoint and restore the redis container checkpoint, err := client.Pull(context, ""myregistry/checkpoints/redis:master"") redis, err = client.NewContainer(context, ""redis-master"", containerd.WithNewSnapshot(""redis-rootfs"", checkpoint)) defer container.Delete(context) task, err = redis.NewTask(context, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio), containerd.WithTaskCheckpoint(checkpoint)) defer task.Delete(context) err := task.Start(context) ``` ### Snapshot Plugins In addition to the built-in Snapshot plugins in containerd, additional external plugins can be configured using GRPC. An external plugin is made available using the configured name and appears as a plugin alongside the built-in ones. To add an external snapshot plugin, add the plugin to containerd's config file (by default at `/etc/containerd/config.toml`). The string following `proxy_plugin.` will be used as the name of the snapshotter and the address should refer to a socket with a GRPC listener serving containerd's Snapshot GRPC API. Remember to restart containerd for any configuration changes to take effect. ``` [proxy_plugins] [proxy_plugins.customsnapshot] type = ""snapshot"" address = ""/var/run/mysnapshotter.sock"" ``` See [PLUGINS.md](/docs/PLUGINS.md) for how to create plugins ### Releases and API Stability Please see [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for details on versioning and stability of containerd components. Downloadable 64-bit Intel/AMD binaries of all official releases are available on our [releases page]( For other architectures and distribution support, you will find that many Linux distributions package their own containerd and provide it across several architectures, such as [Canonical's Ubuntu packaging]( #### Enabling command auto-completion Starting with containerd 1.4, the urfave client feature for auto-creation of bash and zsh autocompletion data is enabled. To use the autocomplete feature in a bash shell for example, source the autocomplete/ctr file in your `.bashrc`, or manually like: ``` $ source ./contrib/autocomplete/ctr ``` #### Distribution of `ctr` autocomplete for bash and zsh For bash, copy the `contrib/autocomplete/ctr` script into `/etc/bash_completion.d/` and rename it to `ctr`. The `zsh_autocomplete` file is also available and can be used similarly for zsh users. Provide documentation to users to `source` this file into their shell if you don't place the autocomplete file in a location where it is automatically loaded for the user's shell environment. ##...

blackbox_exporter,prometheus/blackbox_exporter,4359,"['Go', 'Makefile', 'Dockerfile']","['blackbox-exporter', 'icmp', 'prometheus-exporter', 'prometheus']","# Blackbox exporter [][circleci] [][quay] [][hub] The blackbox exporter allows blackbox probing of endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP and gRPC. ## Running this software ### From binaries Download the most suitable binary from [the releases tab]( Then: ./blackbox_exporter ### Using the docker image *Note: You may want to [enable ipv6 in your docker configuration]( docker run --rm \ -p 9115/tcp \ --name blackbox_exporter \ -v $(pwd):/config \ quay.io/prometheus/blackbox-exporter:latest --config.file=/config/blackbox.yml ### Checking the results Visiting [ will return metrics for a HTTP probe against google.com. The `probe_success` metric indicates if the probe succeeded. Adding a `debug=true` parameter will return debug information for that probe. Metrics concerning the operation of the exporter itself are available at the endpoint . ### TLS and basic authentication The Blackbox Exporter supports TLS and basic authentication. This enables better control of the various HTTP endpoints. To use TLS and/or basic authentication, you need to pass a configuration file using the `--web.config.file` parameter. The format of the file is described [in the exporter-toolkit repository]( Note that the TLS and basic authentication settings affect all HTTP endpoints: /metrics for scraping, /probe for probing, and the web UI. ## Building the software ### Local Build make ### Building with Docker After a successful local build: docker build -t blackbox_exporter . ## [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) Blackbox exporter is configured via a [configuration file](CONFIGURATION.md) and command-line flags (such as what configuration file to load, what port to listen on, and the logging format and level). Blackbox exporter can reload its configuration file at runtime. If the new configuration is not well-formed, the changes will not be applied. A configuration reload is triggered by sending a `SIGHUP` to the Blackbox exporter process or by sending a HTTP POST request to the `/-/reload` endpoint. To view all available command-line flags, run `./blackbox_exporter -h`. To specify which [configuration file](CONFIGURATION.md) to load, use the `--config.file` flag. Additionally, an [example configuration](example.yml) is also available. HTTP, HTTPS (via the ` prober), DNS, TCP socket, ICMP and gRPC (see permissions section) are currently supported. Additional modules can be defined to meet your needs. The timeout of each probe is automatically determined from the `scrape_timeout` in the [Prometheus config]( slightly reduced to allow for network delays. This can be further limited by the `timeout` in the Blackbox exporter config file. If neither is specified, it defaults to 120 seconds. ## Prometheus Configuration Blackbox exporter implements the multi-target exporter pattern, so we advice to read the guide [Understanding and using the multi-target exporter pattern ]( to get the general idea about the configuration. The blackbox exporter needs to be passed the target as a parameter, this can be done with relabelling. Example config: ```yml scrape_configs: - job_name: 'blackbox' metrics_path: /probe params: module: [ # Look for a HTTP 200 response. static_configs: - targets: - # Target to probe with - # Target to probe with - # Target to probe with http on port 8080. relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__address__] target_label: __param_target - source_labels: [__param_target] target_label: instance - target_label: __address__ replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115 # The blackbox exporter's real hostname:port. - job_name: 'blackbox_exporter' # collect blackbox exporter's operational metrics. static_configs: - targets: ['127.0.0.1:9115'] ``` HTTP probes can accept an additional `hostname` parameter that will set `Host` header and TLS SNI. This can be especially useful with `dns_sd_config`: ```yaml scrape_configs: - job_name: blackbox_all metrics_path: /probe params: module: [ ] # Look for a HTTP 200 response. dns_sd_configs: - names: - example.com - prometheus.io type: A port: 443 relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__address__] target_label: __param_target replacement: # Make probe URL be like - source_labels: [__param_target] target_label: instance - target_label: __address__ replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115 # The blackbox exporter's real hostname:port. - source_labels: [__meta_dns_name] target_label: __param_hostname # Make domain name become 'Host' header for probe requests - source_labels: [__meta_dns_name] target_label: vhost # and store it in 'vhost' label ``` ## Permissions The ICMP probe requires elevated privileges to function: * *Windows*: Administrator privileges are required. * *Linux*: either a user with a group within `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`, the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability or the root user is required. * Your distribution may configure `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` by default in `/etc/sysctl.conf` or similar. If not you can set `net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2147483647` to allow any user the ability to use ping. * Alternatively the capability can be set by executing `setcap cap_net_raw+ep blackbox_exporter` * *BSD*: root user is required. * *OS X*: No additional privileges are needed.

buf,bufbuild/buf,8348,"['Go', 'Makefile', 'Shell']","['protocol-buffers', 'protoc', 'grpc', 'protobuf', 'buf-cli']","# Buf []( []( []( []( []( [][badges_slack] The [`buf`][buf] CLI is the best tool for working with [Protocol Buffers][protobuf]. It provides: - A [linter][lint_usage] that enforces good API design choices and structure. - A [breaking change detector][breaking_usage] that enforces compatibility at the source code or wire level. - A [generator][generate_usage] that invokes your plugins based on configurable [templates][templates]. - A [formatter][format_usage] that formats your Protobuf files in accordance with industry standards. - Integration with the [Buf Schema Registry][bsr], including full dependency management. ## Installation ### Homebrew You can install `buf` using [Homebrew][brew] (macOS or Linux): ```sh brew install bufbuild/buf/buf ``` This installs: - The `buf`, [`protoc-gen-buf-breaking`][breaking], and [`protoc-gen-buf-lint`][lint] binaries - Shell completion scripts for [Bash], [Fish], [Powershell], and [zsh] ### Other methods For other installation methods, see our [official documentation][install], which covers: - Installing `buf` via [npm] - Installing `buf` on [Windows] - Using `buf` as a [Docker image][docker] - Installing as a [binary], from a [tarball], and from [source] through [GitHub Releases][releases] - [Verifying] releases using a [minisign] public key ## Usage Buf's help interface provides summaries for commands and flags: ```sh buf --help ``` For more comprehensive usage information, consult Buf's [documentation][docs], especially these guides: * [`buf breaking`][breaking_usage] * [`buf build`][build_usage] * [`buf generate`][generate_usage] * [`buf lint`][lint_usage] * [`buf format`][format_usage] * [`buf registry`][bsr_usage] (for using the [BSR]) ## CLI breaking change policy We will never make breaking changes within a given major version of the CLI. Once `buf` reaches v1.0, you can expect no breaking changes until v2.0. But as we have no plans to ever release a v2.0, we will likely never break the `buf` CLI. > This breaking change policy does _not_ apply to commands behind the `buf beta` gate, and you should expect breaking changes to commands like `buf beta registry`. The policy does go into effect, however, when those commands or flags are elevated out of beta. ## Our goals for Protobuf [Buf]'s goal is to replace the current paradigm of API development, centered around REST/JSON, with a **schema-driven** paradigm. Defining APIs using an [IDL] provides numerous benefits over REST/JSON, and [Protobuf] is by far the most stable and widely adopted IDL in the industry. We've chosen to build on this widely trusted foundation rather than creating a new IDL from scratch. But despite its technical merits, actually _using_ Protobuf has long been more challenging than it needs to be. The Buf CLI and the [BSR](#the-buf-schema-registry) are the cornerstones of our effort to change that for good and to make Protobuf reliable and easy to use for service owners and clients alikein other words, to create a **modern Protobuf ecosystem**. While we intend to incrementally improve on the `buf` CLI and the [BSR](#the-buf-schema-registry), we're confident that the basic groundwork for such an ecosystem is _already_ in place. ## The Buf Schema Registry The [Buf Schema Registry][bsr] (BSR) is a SaaS platform for managing your Protobuf APIs. It provides a centralized registry and a single source of truth for all of your Protobuf assets, including not just your `.proto` files but also [remote plugins][bsr_plugins]. Although the BSR provides an intuitive browser UI, `buf` enables you to perform most BSR-related tasks from the command line, such as [pushing] Protobuf sources to the registry and managing [users] and [repositories]. > The BSR is not required to use `buf`. We've made the core [features] of the `buf` CLI available to _all_ Protobuf users. ## More advanced CLI features While `buf`'s [core features][features] should cover most use cases, we've included some more advanced features to cover edge cases: * **Automatic file discovery**. Buf walks your file tree and builds your `.proto` files in accordance with your supplied [build configuration][build_config], which means that you no longer need to manually specify `--proto_paths`. You can still, however, specify `.proto` files manually through CLI flags in cases where file discovery needs to be disabled. * **Fine-grained rule configuration** for [linting][lint_rules] and [breaking changes][breaking_rules]. While we do have recommended defaults, you can always select the exact set of rules that your use case requires, with [40 lint rules][lint_rules] and [53 breaking change rules][breaking_rules] available. * **Configurable error formats** for CLI output. `buf` outputs information in `file:line:column:message` form by default for each lint error and breaking change it encounters, but you can also select JSON and, in the near future, JUnit output. * **Editor integration** driven by `buf`'s granular error output. We currently provide linting integrations for both [Vim and Visual Studio Code][ide] but we plan to support other editors, such as Emacs and [JetBrains IDEs][jetbrains] like IntelliJ and GoLand, in the future. * **Universal Input targeting**. Buf enables you to perform actions like linting and breaking change detection not just against local `.proto` files but also against a broad range of other [Inputs], such as tarballs and ZIP files, remote Git repositories, and pre-built [image][images] files. * **Speed**. Buf's internal Protobuf compiler compiles your Protobuf sources using all available cores without compromising deterministic output, which is considerably faster than `protoc`. This allows for near-instantaneous feedback, which is of special importance for features like [editor integration][ide]. ## Next steps Once you've installed `buf`, we recommend completing the [Tour of Buf][tour], which provides a broad but hands-on overview of the core functionality of both the CLI and the [BSR]. The tour takes about 10 minutes to complete. After completing the tour, check out the remainder of the [docs] for your specific areas of interest. ## Community For help and discussion around Protobuf, best practices, and more, join us on [Slack][badges_slack].

Ventoy,ventoy/Ventoy,58776,"['C', 'Shell', 'HTML']","['bootable-usb', 'multiboot', 'uefi', 'legacy', 'iso-files']","Ventoy Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files. With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the image files to the USB drive and boot it. You can copy many image files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them. You can also browse ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files in local disk and boot them. x86 Legacy BIOS, IA32 UEFI, x86_64 UEFI, ARM64 UEFI and MIPS64EL UEFI are supported in the same way. Both MBR and GPT partition style are supported in the same way.

Your PRs are a very important part of this firmware and open-source development. The amount of work done on this project is huge and we need your support, no matter how large or small. Even if you just say, ""Thank you Unleashed firmware developers!"" somewhere. Doing so will help us continue our work and will help drive us to make the firmware better every time. Also, regarding our releases, every build has and always will be free and open-source. There will be no paywall releases or closed-source apps within the firmware.

mbedtls,Mbed-TLS/mbedtls,4973,"['C', 'Shell', 'Python']","['tls', 'ssl', 'crypto', 'cryptography-library', 'psa']","README for Mbed TLS =================== Mbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems. Mbed TLS includes a reference implementation of the [PSA Cryptography API](#psa-cryptography-api). This is currently a preview for evaluation purposes only. Configuration ------------- Mbed TLS should build out of the box on most systems. Some platform specific options are available in the fully documented configuration file `include/mbedtls/mbedtls_config.h`, which is also the place where features can be selected. This file can be edited manually, or in a more programmatic way using the Python 3 script `scripts/config.py` (use `--help` for usage instructions). Compiler options can be set using conventional environment variables such as `CC` and `CFLAGS` when using the Make and CMake build system (see below). We provide some non-standard configurations focused on specific use cases in the `configs/` directory. You can read more about those in `configs/README.txt` Documentation ------------- The main Mbed TLS documentation is available via [ReadTheDocs]( Documentation for the PSA Cryptography API is available [on GitHub]( To generate a local copy of the library documentation in HTML format, tailored to your compile-time configuration: 1. Make sure that [Doxygen]( is installed. 1. Run `make apidoc`. 1. Browse `apidoc/index.html` or `apidoc/modules.html`. For other sources of documentation, see the [SUPPORT](SUPPORT.md) document. Compiling --------- There are currently three active build systems used within Mbed TLS releases: - GNU Make - CMake - Microsoft Visual Studio The main systems used for development are CMake and GNU Make. Those systems are always complete and up-to-date. The others should reflect all changes present in the CMake and Make build system, although features may not be ported there automatically. The Make and CMake build systems create three libraries: libmbedcrypto, libmbedx509, and libmbedtls. Note that libmbedtls depends on libmbedx509 and libmbedcrypto, and libmbedx509 depends on libmbedcrypto. As a result, some linkers will expect flags to be in a specific order, for example the GNU linker wants `-lmbedtls -lmbedx509 -lmbedcrypto`. ### Tool versions You need the following tools to build the library with the provided makefiles: * GNU Make 3.82 or a build tool that CMake supports. * A C99 toolchain (compiler, linker, archiver). We actively test with GCC 5.4, Clang 3.8, Arm Compiler 6, IAR 8 and Visual Studio 2017. More recent versions should work. Slightly older versions may work. * Python 3.8 to generate the test code. Python is also needed to integrate PSA drivers and to build the development branch (see next section). * Perl to run the tests, and to generate some source files in the development branch. * CMake 3.10.2 or later (if using CMake). * Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later (if using Visual Studio). * Doxygen 1.8.11 or later (if building the documentation; slightly older versions should work). ### Git usage The `development` branch and the `mbedtls-3.6` long-term support branch of Mbed TLS use a [Git submodule]( ([framework]( This is not needed to merely compile the library at a release tag. This is not needed to consume a release archive (zip or tar). ### Generated source files in the development branch The source code of Mbed TLS includes some files that are automatically generated by scripts and whose content depends only on the Mbed TLS source, not on the platform or on the library configuration. These files are not included in the development branch of Mbed TLS, but the generated files are included in official releases. This section explains how to generate the missing files in the development branch. The following tools are required: * Perl, for some library source files and for Visual Studio build files. * Python 3.8 and some Python packages, for some library source files, sample programs and test data. To install the necessary packages, run: ``` python3 -m pip install --user -r scripts/basic.requirements.txt ``` Depending on your Python installation, you may need to invoke `python` instead of `python3`. To install the packages system-wide, omit the `--user` option. * A C compiler for the host platform, for some test data. If you are cross-compiling, you must set the `CC` environment variable to a C compiler for the host platform when generating the configuration-independent files. Any of the following methods are available to generate the configuration-independent files: * If not cross-compiling, running `make` with any target, or just `make`, will automatically generate required files. * On non-Windows systems, when not cross-compiling, CMake will generate the required files automatically. * Run `make generated_files` to generate all the configuration-independent files. * On Unix/POSIX systems, run `tests/scripts/check-generated-files.sh -u` to generate all the configuration-independent files. * On Windows, run `scripts\make_generated_files.bat` to generate all the configuration-independent files. ### Make We require GNU Make. To build the library and the sample programs, GNU Make and a C compiler are sufficient. Some of the more advanced build targets require some Unix/Linux tools. We intentionally only use a minimum of functionality in the makefiles in order to keep them as simple and independent of different toolchains as possible, to allow users to more easily move between different platforms. Users who need more features are recommended to use CMake. In order to build from the source code using GNU Make, just enter at the command line: make In order to run the tests, enter: make check The tests need Python to be built and Perl to be run. If you don't have one of them installed, you can skip building the tests with: make no_test You'll still be able to run a much smaller set of tests with: programs/test/selftest In order to build for a Windows platform, you should use `WINDOWS_BUILD=1` if the target is Windows but the build environment is Unix-like (for instance when cross-compiling, or compiling from an MSYS shell), and `WINDOWS=1` if the build environment is a Windows shell (for instance using mingw32-make) (in that case some targets will not be available). Setting the variable `SHARED` in your environment will build shared libraries in addition to the static libraries. Setting `DEBUG` gives you a debug build. You can override `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` by setting them in your environment or on the make command line; compiler warning options may be overridden separately using `WARNING_CFLAGS`. Some directory-specific options (for example, `-I` directives) are still preserved. Please note that setting `CFLAGS` overrides its default value of `-O2` and setting `WARNING_CFLAGS` overrides its default value (starting with `-Wall -Wextra`), so if you just want to add some warning options to the default ones, you can do so by setting `CFLAGS=-O2 -Werror` for example. Setting `WARNING_CFLAGS` is useful when you want to get rid of its default content (for example because your compiler doesn't accept `-Wall` as an option). Directory-specific options cannot be overridden from the command line. Depending on your platform, you might run into some issues. Please check the Makefiles in `library/`, `programs/` and `tests/` for options to manually add or remove for specific platforms. You can also check [the Mbed TLS Knowledge Base]( for articles on your platform or issue. In case you find that you need to do something else as well, please let us know what, so we can add it to the [Mbed TLS Knowledge Base]( ### CMake In order to build the source using CMake in a separate directory (recommended), just enter at the command line: mkdir /path/to/build_dir && cd /path/to/build_dir cmake /path/to/mbedtls_source cmake --build . In order to run the tests, enter: ctest The test suites need Python to be built and Perl to be executed. If you don't have one of these installed, you'll want to disable the test suites with: cmake -DENABLE_TESTING=Off /path/to/mbedtls_source If you disabled the test suites, but kept the programs enabled, you can still run a much smaller set of tests with: programs/test/selftest To configure CMake for building shared libraries, use: cmake -DUSE_SHARED_MBEDTLS_LIBRARY=On /path/to/mbedtls_source There are many different build modes available within the CMake buildsystem. Most of them are available for gcc and clang, though some are compiler-specific: - `Release`. This generates the default code without any unnecessary information in the binary files. - `Debug`. This generates debug information and disables optimization of the code. - `Coverage`. This generates code coverage information in addition to debug information. - `ASan`. This instruments the code with AddressSanitizer to check for memory errors. (This includes LeakSanitizer, with recent version of gcc and clang.) (With recent version of clang, this mode also instruments the code with UndefinedSanitizer to check for undefined behaviour.) - `ASanDbg`. Same as ASan but slower, with debug information and better stack traces. - `MemSan`. This instruments the code with MemorySanitizer to check for uninitialised memory reads. Experimental, needs recent clang on Linux/x86\_64. - `MemSanDbg`. Same as MemSan but slower, with debug information, better stack traces and origin tracking. - `Check`. This activates the compiler warnings that depend on optimization and treats all warnings as errors. Switching build modes in CMake is simple. For debug mode, enter at the command line: cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/mbedtls_source To list other available CMake options, use: cmake -LH Note that, with CMake, you can't adjust the compiler or its flags after the initial invocation of cmake. This means that `CC=your_cc make` and `make CC=your_cc` will *not* work (similarly with `CFLAGS` and ot...

pg_cron,citusdata/pg_cron,2596,"['C', 'PLSQL', 'Makefile']","['postgresql', 'cron', 'periodic-jobs', 'scheduler']","[]( ## What is pg_cron? pg_cron is a simple cron-based job scheduler for PostgreSQL (10 or higher) that runs inside the database as an extension. It uses the same syntax as regular cron, but it allows you to schedule PostgreSQL commands directly from the database. You can also use '[1-59] seconds' to schedule a job based on an interval. pg_cron also allows you using '$' to indicate last day of the month. ```sql -- Delete old data on Saturday at 3:30am (GMT) SELECT cron.schedule('30 3 * * 6', $$DELETE FROM events WHERE event_time < now() - interval '1 week'$$); schedule ---------- 42 -- Vacuum every day at 10:00am (GMT) SELECT cron.schedule('nightly-vacuum', '0 10 * * *', 'VACUUM'); schedule ---------- 43 -- Change to vacuum at 3:00am (GMT) SELECT cron.schedule('nightly-vacuum', '0 3 * * *', 'VACUUM'); schedule ---------- 43 -- Stop scheduling jobs SELECT cron.unschedule('nightly-vacuum' ); unschedule ------------ t SELECT cron.unschedule(42); unschedule ------------ t -- Vacuum every Sunday at 4:00am (GMT) in a database other than the one pg_cron is installed in SELECT cron.schedule_in_database('weekly-vacuum', '0 4 * * 0', 'VACUUM', 'some_other_database'); schedule ---------- 44 -- Call a stored procedure every 5 seconds SELECT cron.schedule('process-updates', '5 seconds', 'CALL process_updates()'); -- Process payroll at 12:00 of the last day of each month SELECT cron.schedule('process-payroll', '0 12 $ * *', 'CALL process_payroll()'); ``` pg_cron can run multiple jobs in parallel, but it runs at most one instance of a job at a time. If a second run is supposed to start before the first one finishes, then the second run is queued and started as soon as the first run completes. The schedule uses the standard cron syntax, in which * means ""run every time period"", and a specific number means ""but only at this time"": ``` min (0 - 59) hour (0 - 23) day of month (1 - 31) or last day of the month ($) month (1 - 12) day of week (0 - 6) (0 to 6 are Sunday to Saturday, or use names; 7 is also Sunday) * * * * * ``` An easy way to create a cron schedule is: [crontab.guru]( The code in pg_cron that handles parsing and scheduling comes directly from the cron source code by Paul Vixie, hence the same options are supported. ## Installing pg_cron Install on Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, Amazon Linux with PostgreSQL 16 using [PGDG]( ```bash # Install the pg_cron extension sudo yum install -y pg_cron_16 ``` Install on Debian, Ubuntu with PostgreSQL 16 using [apt.postgresql.org]( ```bash # Install the pg_cron extension sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-16-cron ``` You can also install pg_cron by building it from source: ```bash git clone cd pg_cron # Ensure pg_config is in your path, e.g. export PATH=/usr/pgsql-16/bin:$PATH make && sudo PATH=$PATH make install ``` ## Setting up pg_cron To start the pg_cron background worker when PostgreSQL starts, you need to add pg_cron to `shared_preload_libraries` in postgresql.conf. Note that pg_cron does not run any jobs as a long a server is in [hot standby]( mode, but it automatically starts when the server is promoted. ``` # add to postgresql.conf # required to load pg_cron background worker on start-up shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron' ``` By default, the pg_cron background worker expects its metadata tables to be created in the ""postgres"" database. However, you can configure this by setting the `cron.database_name` configuration parameter in postgresql.conf. ``` # add to postgresql.conf # optionally, specify the database in which the pg_cron background worker should run (defaults to postgres) cron.database_name = 'postgres' ``` `pg_cron` may only be installed to one database in a cluster. If you need to run jobs in multiple databases, use `cron.schedule_in_database()`. Previously pg_cron could only use GMT time, but now you can adapt your time by setting `cron.timezone` in postgresql.conf. ``` # add to postgresql.conf # optionally, specify the timezone in which the pg_cron background worker should run (defaults to GMT). E.g: cron.timezone = 'PRC' ``` After restarting PostgreSQL, you can create the pg_cron functions and metadata tables using `CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron`. ```sql -- run as superuser: CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron; -- optionally, grant usage to regular users: GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA cron TO marco; ``` ### Ensuring pg_cron can start jobs **Important**: By default, pg_cron uses libpq to open a new connection to the local database, which needs to be allowed by [pg_hba.conf]( It may be necessary to enable `trust` authentication for connections coming from localhost in for the user running the cron job, or you can add the password to a [.pgpass file]( which libpq will use when opening a connection. You can also use a unix domain socket directory as the hostname and enable `trust` authentication for local connections in [pg_hba.conf]( which is normally safe: ``` # Connect via a unix domain socket: cron.host = '/tmp' # Can also be an empty string to look for the default directory: cron.host = '' ``` Alternatively, pg_cron can be configured to use background workers. In that case, the number of concurrent jobs is limited by the `max_worker_processes` setting, so you may need to raise that. ``` # Schedule jobs via background workers instead of localhost connections cron.use_background_workers = on # Increase the number of available background workers from the default of 8 max_worker_processes = 20 ``` For security, jobs are executed in the database in which the `cron.schedule` function is called with the same permissions as the current user. In addition, users are only able to see their own jobs in the `cron.job` table. ## Viewing job run details You can view the status of running and recently completed job runs in the `cron.job_run_details`: ```sql select * from cron.job_run_details order by start_time desc limit 5; jobid runid job_pid database username command status return_message start_time end_time 10 4328 2610 postgres marco select process() succeeded SELECT 1 2023-02-07 09:30:00.098164+01 2023-02-07 09:30:00.130729+01 10 4327 2609 postgres marco select process() succeeded SELECT 1 2023-02-07 09:29:00.015168+01 2023-02-07 09:29:00.832308+01 10 4321 2603 postgres marco select process() succeeded SELECT 1 2023-02-07 09:28:00.011965+01 2023-02-07 09:28:01.420901+01 10 4320 2602 postgres marco select process() failed server restarted 2023-02-07 09:27:00.011833+01 2023-02-07 09:27:00.72121+01 9 4320 2602 postgres marco select do_stuff() failed job canceled 2023-02-07 09:26:00.011833+01 2023-02-07 09:26:00.22121+01 (10 rows) ``` The records in `cron.job_run_details` are not cleaned automatically, but every user that can schedule cron jobs also has permission to delete their own `cron.job_run_details` records. Especially when you have jobs that run every few seconds, it can be a good idea to clean up regularly, which can easily be done using pg_cron itself: ```sql -- Delete old cron.job_run_details records of the current user every day at noon SELECT cron.schedule('delete-job-run-details', '0 12 * * *', $$DELETE FROM cron.job_run_details WHERE end_time < now() - interval '7 days'$$); ``` If you do not want to use `cron.job_run_details` at all, then you can add `cron.log_run = off` to `postgresql.conf`. ## Example use cases Articles showing possible ways of using pg_cron: * [Auto-partitioning using pg_partman]( * [Computing rollups in an analytical dashboard]( * [Deleting old data, vacuum]( * [Feeding cats]( * [Routinely invoking a function]( * [Postgres as a cron server]( ## Managed services The following table keeps track of which of the major managed Postgres services support pg_cron. | Service | Supported | | ------------- |:-------------:| | [Aiven]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Alibaba Cloud]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Amazon RDS]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | | [Azure]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Crunchy Bridge]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [DigitalOcean]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Google Cloud]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Heroku]( | :x: | | | [ScaleGrid]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Scaleway]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Supabase]( | :heavy_check_mark: | | [Tembo]( | :heavy_check_mark: | ## Code of Conduct This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct]( For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ]( or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.","183, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, enhancement, bug, wontfix, question, invalid, help wanted, duplicate"

open-gpu-kernel-modules,NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules,14059,"['C', 'C++', 'Shell']",[],"# NVIDIA Linux Open GPU Kernel Module Source This is the source release of the NVIDIA Linux open GPU kernel modules, version 550.78. ## How to Build To build: make modules -j$(nproc) To install, first uninstall any existing NVIDIA kernel modules. Then, as root: make modules_install -j$(nproc) Note that the kernel modules built here must be used with GSP firmware and user-space NVIDIA GPU driver components from a corresponding 550.78 driver release. This can be achieved by installing the NVIDIA GPU driver from the .run file using the `--no-kernel-modules` option. E.g., sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-[...].run --no-kernel-modules ## Supported Target CPU Architectures Currently, the kernel modules can be built for x86_64 or aarch64. If cross-compiling, set these variables on the make command line: TARGET_ARCH=aarch64|x86_64 CC LD AR CXX OBJCOPY E.g., # compile on x86_64 for aarch64 make modules -j$(nproc) \ TARGET_ARCH=aarch64 \ CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc \ LD=aarch64-linux-gnu-ld \ AR=aarch64-linux-gnu-ar \ CXX=aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ \ OBJCOPY=aarch64-linux-gnu-objcopy ## Other Build Knobs NV_VERBOSE - Set this to ""1"" to print each complete command executed; otherwise, a succinct ""CC"" line is printed. DEBUG - Set this to ""1"" to build the kernel modules as debug. By default, the build compiles without debugging information. This also enables various debug log messages in the kernel modules. These variables can be set on the make command line. E.g., make modules -j$(nproc) NV_VERBOSE=1 ## Supported Toolchains Any reasonably modern version of GCC or Clang can be used to build the kernel modules. Note that the kernel interface layers of the kernel modules must be built with the toolchain that was used to build the kernel. ## Supported Linux Kernel Versions The NVIDIA open kernel modules support the same range of Linux kernel versions that are supported with the proprietary NVIDIA kernel modules. This is currently Linux kernel 3.10 or newer. ## How to Contribute Contributions can be made by creating a pull request on We'll respond via GitHub. Note that when submitting a pull request, you will be prompted to accept a Contributor License Agreement. This code base is shared with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers, and various processing is performed on the shared code to produce the source code that is published here. This has several implications for the foreseeable future: * The GitHub repository will function mostly as a snapshot of each driver release. * We do not expect to be able to provide revision history for individual changes that were made to NVIDIA's shared code base. There will likely only be one git commit per driver release. * We may not be able to reflect individual contributions as separate git commits in the GitHub repository. * Because the code undergoes various processing prior to publishing here, contributions made here require manual merging to be applied to the shared code base. Therefore, large refactoring changes made here may be difficult to merge and accept back into the shared code base. If you have large refactoring to suggest, please contact us in advance, so we can coordinate. ## How to Report Issues Problems specific to the Open GPU Kernel Modules can be reported in the Issues section of the repository. Further, any of the existing bug reporting venues can be used to communicate problems to NVIDIA, such as our forum: or linux-bugs@nvidia.com. Please see the 'NVIDIA Contact Info and Additional Resources' section of the NVIDIA GPU Driver README for details. Please see the separate [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) document if you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in this software. ## Kernel Interface and OS-Agnostic Components of Kernel Modules Most of NVIDIA's kernel modules are split into two components: * An ""OS-agnostic"" component: this is the component of each kernel module that is independent of operating system. * A ""kernel interface layer"": this is the component of each kernel module that is specific to the Linux kernel version and configuration. When packaged in the NVIDIA .run installation package, the OS-agnostic component is provided as a binary: it is large and time-consuming to compile, so pre-built versions are provided so that the user does not have to compile it during every driver installation. For the nvidia.ko kernel module, this component is named ""nv-kernel.o_binary"". For the nvidia-modeset.ko kernel module, this component is named ""nv-modeset-kernel.o_binary"". Neither nvidia-drm.ko nor nvidia-uvm.ko have OS-agnostic components. The kernel interface layer component for each kernel module must be built for the target kernel. ## Directory Structure Layout - `kernel-open/` The kernel interface layer - `kernel-open/nvidia/` The kernel interface layer for nvidia.ko - `kernel-open/nvidia-drm/` The kernel interface layer for nvidia-drm.ko - `kernel-open/nvidia-modeset/` The kernel interface layer for nvidia-modeset.ko - `kernel-open/nvidia-uvm/` The kernel interface layer for nvidia-uvm.ko - `src/` The OS-agnostic code - `src/nvidia/` The OS-agnostic code for nvidia.ko - `src/nvidia-modeset/` The OS-agnostic code for nvidia-modeset.ko - `src/common/` Utility code used by one or more of nvidia.ko and nvidia-modeset.ko - `nouveau/` Tools for integration with the Nouveau device driver ## Nouveau device driver integration The Python script in the 'nouveau' directory is used to extract some of the firmware binary images (and related data) encoded in the source code and store them as distinct files. These files are used by the Nouveau device driver to load and communicate with the GSP firmware. The layout of the binary files is described in nouveau_firmware_layout.ods, which is an OpenDocument Spreadsheet file, compatible with most spreadsheet software applications. ## Compatible GPUs The NVIDIA open kernel modules can be used on any Turing or later GPU (see the table below). However, in the __DRIVER_VERION__ release, GeForce and Workstation support is considered to be Beta quality. The open kernel modules are suitable for broad usage, and NVIDIA requests feedback on any issues encountered specific to them. For details on feature support and limitations, see the NVIDIA GPU driver end user README here: For vGPU support, please refer to the README.vgpu packaged in the vGPU Host Package for more details.

In particular, OQS provides prototype integrations of liboqs into protocols like TLS, X.509, and S/MIME, through our [OpenSSL 3 Provider]( and we provide a variety of other [post-quantum-enabled demos]( The OQS project is supported by the [Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance]( as part of the [Linux Foundation]( More information about the Open Quantum Safe project can be found at [openquantumsafe.org]( ## Status ### Supported Algorithms Details on each supported algorithm can be found in the [docs/algorithms]( folder. The list below indicates all algorithms currently supported by liboqs, including experimental algorithms and already excluding algorithm variants pruned during the NIST competition, such as Kyber-90s or Dilithium-AES. The only algorithms in `liboqs` that implement NIST standards drafts are the [`ML-KEM`]( and [`ML-DSA`]( variants with their respective different bit strengths. `liboqs` will retain these algorithm names selected by NIST throughout the finishing stages of the standardization process, so users can rely on their presence going forward. If NIST changes the implementation details of these algorithms, `liboqs` will adjust the implementation so that users are protected from such potential changes. For users interested in explicitly selecting the current ""proposed draft standard"" code, the variants with the suffix ""-ipd"" are made available. At this stage, ""ml-kem-ipd"" and ""ml-kem"" as well as ""ml-dsa-ipd"" and ""ml-dsa"" are functionally equivalent, denoted by the ""alias"" moniker below. Falcon and SPHINCS+ have also been [selected for standardization]( but the `liboqs` implementations of these algorithms are currently tracking Round 3 submissions and not NIST standards drafts. All names other than `ML-KEM` and `ML-DSA` are subject to change. `liboqs` makes available a [selection mechanism for algorithms on the NIST standards track, continued NIST competition, or purely experimental nature by way of the configuration variable OQS_ALGS_ENABLED](CONFIGURE.md#oqs_algs_enabled). By default `liboqs` is built supporting all, incl. experimental, PQ algorithms listed below. #### Key encapsulation mechanisms - **BIKE**: BIKE-L1, BIKE-L3, BIKE-L5 - **Classic McEliece**: Classic-McEliece-348864, Classic-McEliece-348864f, Classic-McEliece-460896, Classic-McEliece-460896f, Classic-McEliece-6688128, Classic-McEliece-6688128f, Classic-McEliece-6960119, Classic-McEliece-6960119f, Classic-McEliece-8192128, Classic-McEliece-8192128f - **FrodoKEM**: FrodoKEM-640-AES, FrodoKEM-640-SHAKE, FrodoKEM-976-AES, FrodoKEM-976-SHAKE, FrodoKEM-1344-AES, FrodoKEM-1344-SHAKE - **HQC**: HQC-128, HQC-192, HQC-256 - **Kyber**: Kyber512, Kyber768, Kyber1024 - **ML-KEM**: ML-KEM-512-ipd (alias: ML-KEM-512), ML-KEM-768-ipd (alias: ML-KEM-768), ML-KEM-1024-ipd (alias: ML-KEM-1024) - **NTRU-Prime**: sntrup761 #### Signature schemes - **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**: Dilithium2, Dilithium3, Dilithium5 - **Falcon**: Falcon-512, Falcon-1024, Falcon-padded-512, Falcon-padded-1024 - **ML-DSA**: ML-DSA-44-ipd (alias: ML-DSA-44), ML-DSA-65-ipd (alias: ML-DSA-65), ML-DSA-87-ipd (alias: ML-DSA-87) - **SPHINCS+-SHA2**: SPHINCS+-SHA2-128f-simple, SPHINCS+-SHA2-128s-simple, SPHINCS+-SHA2-192f-simple, SPHINCS+-SHA2-192s-simple, SPHINCS+-SHA2-256f-simple, SPHINCS+-SHA2-256s-simple - **SPHINCS+-SHAKE**: SPHINCS+-SHAKE-128f-simple, SPHINCS+-SHAKE-128s-simple, SPHINCS+-SHAKE-192f-simple, SPHINCS+-SHAKE-192s-simple, SPHINCS+-SHAKE-256f-simple, SPHINCS+-SHAKE-256s-simple Note that for algorithms marked with a dagger (), liboqs contains at least one implementation that uses a large amount of stack space; this may cause failures when run in threads or in constrained environments. For more information, consult the algorithm information sheets in the [docs/algorithms]( folder. ### Limitations and Security While at the time of this writing there are no vulnerabilities known in any of the quantum-safe algorithms used in this library, caution is advised when deploying quantum-safe algorithms as most of the algorithms and software have not been subject to the same degree of scrutiny as for currently deployed algorithms. Particular attention should be paid to guidance provided by the standards community, especially from the NIST [Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]( project. As research advances, the supported algorithms may see rapid changes in their security, and may even prove insecure against both classical and quantum computers. Moreover, note that the `sntrup761` is only included for interop testing. liboqs does not intend to ""pick winners"": algorithm support is informed by the NIST PQC standardization project. We strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of this effort when deploying post-quantum cryptography. We realize some parties may want to deploy quantum-safe cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST PQC standardization project. We strongly recommend such attempts make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which quantum-safe public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography. **WE DO NOT CURRENTLY RECOMMEND RELYING ON THIS LIBRARY IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT OR TO PROTECT ANY SENSITIVE DATA.** This library is meant to help with research and prototyping. While we make a best-effort approach to avoid security bugs, this library has not received the level of auditing and analysis that would be necessary to rely on it for high security use. #### Platform limitations In order to optimize support effort, - not all algorithms are equally well supported on all platforms. In case of questions, it is first advised to review the [documentation files for each algorithm](docs/algorithms). - not all compilers are equally well supported. For example, at least v7.1.0 of the GNU compiler is required. ## Quickstart ### Linux and Mac 1. Install dependencies: On Ubuntu: sudo apt install astyle cmake gcc ninja-build libssl-dev python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist unzip xsltproc doxygen graphviz python3-yaml valgrind On macOS, using a package manager of your choice (we've picked Homebrew): brew install cmake ninja openssl@3 wget doxygen graphviz astyle valgrind pip3 install pytest pytest-xdist pyyaml Note that, if you want liboqs to use OpenSSL for various symmetric crypto algorithms (AES, SHA-2, etc.) then you must have OpenSSL installed (version 3.x recommended; EOL version 1.1.1 also still possible). 2. Get the source: git clone -b main cd liboqs and build: mkdir build && cd build cmake -GNinja .. ninja Various `cmake` build options to customize the resultant artifacts are available and are [documented in CONFIGURE.md](CONFIGURE.md#options-for-configuring-liboqs-builds). All supported options are also listed in the `.CMake/alg-support.cmake` file, and can be viewed by running `cmake -LAH ..` in the `build` directory. The following instructions assume we are in `build`. 3. By default the main build result is `lib/liboqs.a`, a static library. If you want to build a shared/dynamic library, append [`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`](CONFIGURE.md#build_shared_libs) to the `cmake -GNinja ..` command above and the result will be `lib/liboqs.so|dylib|dll`. The public headers are located in the `include` directory. There are also a variety of programs built under the `tests` directory: - `test_kem`: Simple test harness for key encapsulation mechanisms - `test_sig`: Simple test harness for key signature schemes - `test_kem_mem`: Simple test harness for checking memory consumption of key encapsulation mechanisms - `test_sig_mem`: Simple test harness for checking memory consumption of key signature schemes - `kat_kem`: Program that generates known answer test (KAT) values for key encapsulation mechanisms using the same procedure as the NIST submission requirements, for checking against submitted KAT values using `tests/test_kat.py` - `kat_sig`: Program that generates known answer test (KAT) values for signature schemes using the same procedure as the NIST submission requirements, for checking against submitted KAT values using `tests/test_kat.py` - `speed_kem`: Benchmarking program for key encapsulation mechanisms; see `./speed_kem --help` for usage instructions - `speed_sig`: Benchmarking program for signature mechanisms; see `./speed_sig --help` for usage instructions - `example_kem`: Minimal runnable example showing the usage of the KEM API - `example_sig`: Minimal runnable example showing the usage of the signature API - `test_aes`, `test_sha3`: Simple test harnesses for crypto sub-components - `test_portability`: Simple test harnesses for checking cross-CPU code portability; requires presence of `qemu`; proper operatio...

cuda-samples,NVIDIA/cuda-samples,5481,"['C', 'C++', 'Makefile']","['cuda', 'cuda-kernels', 'cuda-opengl', 'cuda-driver-api']","# CUDA Samples Samples for CUDA Developers which demonstrates features in CUDA Toolkit. This version supports [CUDA Toolkit 12.4]( ## Release Notes This section describes the release notes for the CUDA Samples on GitHub only. ### CUDA 12.4 - Hopper Confidential Computing Modes do not support Video samples, nor do they support host-pinned memory due to the restrictions created by CPU IOMMUs. The following Samples are affected: - convolutionTexture - cudaNvSci - dct8x8 - lineOfSight - simpleCubemapTexture - simpleIPC - simpleLayeredTexture - simplePitchLinearTexture - simpleStream - simpleTexture - simpleTextureDrv - watershedSegmentationNPP ### [older versions...](./CHANGELOG.md) ## Getting Started ### Prerequisites Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 12.4]( for your corresponding platform. For system requirements and installation instructions of cuda toolkit, please refer to the [Linux Installation Guide]( and the [Windows Installation Guide]( ### Getting the CUDA Samples Using git clone the repository of CUDA Samples using the command below. ``` git clone ``` Without using git the easiest way to use these samples is to download the zip file containing the current version by clicking the ""Download ZIP"" button on the repo page. You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples. ## Building CUDA Samples ### Windows The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format: ``` *_vs.sln - for Visual Studio ``` Complete samples solution files exist at parent directory of the repo: Each individual sample has its own set of solution files at: `\Samples\\` To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used. ### Linux The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make: ``` $ cd $ make ``` The samples makefiles can take advantage of certain options: * **TARGET_ARCH=** - cross-compile targeting a specific architecture. Allowed architectures are x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l, aarch64. By default, TARGET_ARCH is set to HOST_ARCH. On a x86_64 machine, not setting TARGET_ARCH is the equivalent of setting TARGET_ARCH=x86_64. `$ make TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` `$ make TARGET_ARCH=ppc64le` `$ make TARGET_ARCH=armv7l` `$ make TARGET_ARCH=aarch64` See [here]( for more details on cross platform compilation of cuda samples. * **dbg=1** - build with debug symbols ``` $ make dbg=1 ``` * **SMS=""A B ...""** - override the SM architectures for which the sample will be built, where `""A B ...""` is a space-delimited list of SM architectures. For example, to generate SASS for SM 50 and SM 60, use `SMS=""50 60""`. ``` $ make SMS=""50 60"" ``` * **HOST_COMPILER=** - override the default g++ host compiler. See the [Linux Installation Guide]( for a list of supported host compilers. ``` $ make HOST_COMPILER=g++ ``` ## Samples list ### [0.

Learn more about our offerings: - [TDengine OSS]( a high-performance open-source time-series database - [TDengine Enterprise]( a next generation data historian for Industry 4.0 and the Industrial IoT - [TDengine Cloud]( a fully managed cloud service for industrial big data # Documentation For user manual, system design and architecture, please refer to [TDengine Documentation]( # Building At the moment, TDengine server supports running on Linux/Windows/macOS systems. Any application can also choose the RESTful interface provided by taosAdapter to connect the taosd service . TDengine supports X64/ARM64 CPU, and it will support MIPS64, Alpha64, ARM32, RISC-V and other CPU architectures in the future. Right now we don't support build with cross-compiling environment. You can choose to install through source code, [container]( [installation package]( or [Kubernetes]( This quick guide only applies to installing from source. TDengine provide a few useful tools such as taosBenchmark (was named taosdemo) and taosdump. They were part of TDengine. By default, TDengine compiling does not include taosTools. You can use `cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true` to make them be compiled with TDengine. To build TDengine, use [CMake]( 3.13.0 or higher versions in the project directory. ## Install build tools ### Ubuntu 18.04 and above or Debian ```bash sudo apt-get install -y gcc cmake build-essential git libssl-dev libgflags2.2 libgflags-dev libexpat1-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libmxml-dev geos-devel ``` #### Install build dependencies for taosTools To build the [taosTools]( on Ubuntu/Debian, the following packages need to be installed. ```bash sudo apt install build-essential libjansson-dev libsnappy-dev liblzma-dev libz-dev zlib1g pkg-config ``` ### CentOS 7.9 ```bash sudo yum install epel-release sudo yum update sudo yum install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake3 gflags git openssl-devel expat-devel geos-devel sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake ``` ### CentOS 8/Fedora/Rocky Linux ```bash sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make cmake epel-release gflags git openssl-devel ``` #### Install build dependencies for taosTools on CentOS #### CentOS 7.9 ``` sudo yum install -y zlib-devel zlib-static xz-devel snappy-devel jansson jansson-devel pkgconfig libatomic libatomic-static libstdc++-static openssl-devel ``` #### CentOS 8/Fedora/Rocky Linux ``` sudo yum install -y epel-release sudo yum install -y dnf-plugins-core sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools sudo yum install -y zlib-devel zlib-static xz-devel snappy-devel jansson jansson-devel pkgconfig libatomic libatomic-static libstdc++-static openssl-devel ``` Note: Since snappy lacks pkg-config support (refer to [link]( it leads a cmake prompt libsnappy not found. But snappy still works well. If the PowerTools installation fails, you can try to use: ``` sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools ``` #### For CentOS + devtoolset Besides above dependencies, please run following commands: ``` sudo yum install centos-release-scl sudo yum install devtoolset-9 devtoolset-9-libatomic-devel scl enable devtoolset-9 -- bash ``` ### macOS ``` brew install argp-standalone gflags pkgconfig ``` ### Setup golang environment TDengine includes a few components like taosAdapter developed by Go language. Please refer to golang.org official documentation for golang environment setup. Please use version 1.20+. For the user in China, we recommend using a proxy to accelerate package downloading. ``` go env -w GO111MODULE=on go env -w GOPROXY= ``` The default will not build taosAdapter, but you can use the following command to build taosAdapter as the service for RESTful interface. ``` cmake .. -DBUILD_HTTP=false ``` ### Setup rust environment TDengine includes a few components developed by Rust language. Please refer to rust-lang.org official documentation for rust environment setup. ## Get the source codes First of all, you may clone the source codes from github: ```bash git clone cd TDengine ``` You can modify the file ~/.gitconfig to use ssh protocol instead of for better download speed. You will need to upload ssh public key to GitHub first. Please refer to GitHub official documentation for detail. ``` [url ""git@github.com:""] insteadOf = ``` ## Special Note [JDBC Connector]( [Go Connector]( Connector]( Connector]( Connector]( [Rust Connector]( and [Grafana plugin]( has been moved to standalone repository. ## Build TDengine ### On Linux platform You can run the bash script `build.sh` to build both TDengine and taosTools including taosBenchmark and taosdump as below: ```bash ./build.sh ``` It equals to execute following commands: ```bash mkdir debug cd debug cmake .. -DBUILD_TOOLS=true -DBUILD_CONTRIB=true make ``` You can use Jemalloc as memory allocator instead of glibc: ``` apt install autoconf cmake .. -DJEMALLOC_ENABLED=true ``` TDengine build script can detect the host machine's architecture on X86-64, X86, arm64 platform. You can also specify CPUTYPE option like aarch64 too if the detection result is not correct: aarch64: ```bash cmake .. -DCPUTYPE=aarch64 && cmake --build . ``` ### On Windows platform If you use the Visual Studio 2013, please open a command window by executing ""cmd.exe"". Please specify ""amd64"" for 64 bits Windows or specify ""x86"" for 32 bits Windows when you execute vcvarsall.bat. ```cmd mkdir debug && cd debug ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" < amd64 | x86 > cmake .. -G ""NMake Makefiles"" nmake ``` If you use the Visual Studio 2019 or 2017: please open a command window by executing ""cmd.exe"". Please specify ""x64"" for 64 bits Windows or specify ""x86"" for 32 bits Windows when you execute vcvarsall.bat. ```cmd mkdir debug && cd debug ""c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat"" < x64 | x86 > cmake .. -G ""NMake Makefiles"" nmake ``` Or, you can simply open a command window by clicking Windows Start -> ""Visual Studio < 2019 | 2017 >"" folder -> ""x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS < 2019 | 2017 >"" or ""x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS < 2019 | 2017 >"" depends what architecture your Windows is, then execute commands as follows: ```cmd mkdir debug && cd debug cmake .. -G ""NMake Makefiles"" nmake ``` ### On macOS platform Please install XCode command line tools and cmake. Verified with XCode 11.4+ on Catalina and Big Sur. ```shell mkdir debug && cd debug cmake .. && cmake --build . ``` # Installing ## On Linux platform After building successfully, TDengine can be installed by ```bash sudo make install ``` Users can find more information about directories installed on the system in the [directory and files]( section. Installing from source code will also configure service management for TDengine.Users can also choose to [install from packages]( for it. To start the service after installation, in a terminal, use: ```bash sudo systemctl start taosd ``` Then users can use the TDengine CLI to connect the TDengine server. In a terminal, use: ```bash taos ``` If TDengine CLI connects the server successfully, welcome messages and version info are printed. Otherwise, an error message is shown. ## On Windows platform After building successfully, TDengine can be installed by: ```cmd nmake install ``` ## On macOS platform After building successfully, TDengine can be installed by: ```bash sudo make install ``` Users can find more information about directories installed on the system in the [directory and files]( section. Installing from source code will also configure service management for TDengine.Users can also choose to [install from packages]( for it. To start the service after installation, double-click the /applications/TDengine to start the program, or in a terminal, use: ```bash sudo launchctl start com.tdengine.taosd ``` Then users can use the TDengine CLI to connect the TDengine server. In a terminal, use: ```bash taos ``` If TDengine CLI connects the server successfully, welcome messages and version info are printed. Otherwise, an error message is shown. ## Quick Run If you don't want to run TDengine as a service, you can run it in current shell. For example, to quickly start a TDengine server after building, run the command below in terminal: (We take Linux as an example, command on Windows will be `taosd.exe`) ```bash ./build/bin/taosd -c test/cfg ``` In another terminal, use the TDengine CLI to connect the server: ```bash ./build/bin/taos -c test/cfg ``` option ""-c test/cfg"" specifies the system configuration file directory. # Try TDengine It is easy to run SQL commands from TDengine CLI which is the same as other SQL databases. ```sql CREATE DATABASE demo; USE demo; CREATE TABLE t (ts TIMESTAMP, speed INT); INSERT INTO t VALUES('2019-07-15 00:00:00', 10); INSERT INTO t VALUES('2019-07-15 01:00:00', 20); SELECT * FROM t; ts | speed | ========================...

There are also instructions for [GitHub Actions]( ### Windows Ensure [C++ support in Visual Studio]( is installed, and run: ```cmd call ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"" ``` Note: The exact path will vary depending on your Visual Studio version and edition Then use `nmake` to build: ```cmd set ""PGROOT=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16"" cd %TEMP% git clone --branch v0.7.0 cd pgvector nmake /F Makefile.win nmake /F Makefile.win install ``` See the [installation notes](#installation-notes---windows) if you run into issues You can also install it with [Docker](#docker) or [conda-forge](#conda-forge). ## Getting Started Enable the extension (do this once in each database where you want to use it) ```tsql CREATE EXTENSION vector; ``` Create a vector column with 3 dimensions ```sql CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3)); ``` Insert vectors ```sql INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]'); ``` Get the nearest neighbors by L2 distance ```sql SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5; ``` Also supports inner product (`<#>`), cosine distance (`<=>`), and L1 distance (`<+>`, added in 0.7.0) Note: `<#>` returns the negative inner product since Postgres only supports `ASC` order index scans on operators ## Storing Create a new table with a vector column ```sql CREATE TABLE items (id bigserial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(3)); ``` Or add a vector column to an existing table ```sql ALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3); ``` Insert vectors ```sql INSERT INTO items (embedding) VALUES ('[1,2,3]'), ('[4,5,6]'); ``` Or load vectors in bulk using `COPY` ([example]( ```sql COPY items (embedding) FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT BINARY); ``` Upsert vectors ```sql INSERT INTO items (id, embedding) VALUES (1, '[1,2,3]'), (2, '[4,5,6]') ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET embedding = EXCLUDED.embedding; ``` Update vectors ```sql UPDATE items SET embedding = '[1,2,3]' WHERE id = 1; ``` Delete vectors ```sql DELETE FROM items WHERE id = 1; ``` ## Querying Get the nearest neighbors to a vector ```sql SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5; ``` Supported distance functions are: - `<->` - L2 distance - `<#>` - (negative) inner product - `<=>` - cosine distance - `<+>` - L1 distance (added in 0.7.0) Get the nearest neighbors to a row ```sql SELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1) LIMIT 5; ``` Get rows within a certain distance ```sql SELECT * FROM items WHERE embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' < 5; ``` Note: Combine with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to use an index #### Distances Get the distance ```sql SELECT embedding <-> '[3,1,2]' AS distance FROM items; ``` For inner product, multiply by -1 (since `<#>` returns the negative inner product) ```tsql SELECT (embedding <#> '[3,1,2]') * -1 AS inner_product FROM items; ``` For cosine similarity, use 1 - cosine distance ```sql SELECT 1 - (embedding <=> '[3,1,2]') AS cosine_similarity FROM items; ``` #### Aggregates Average vectors ```sql SELECT AVG(embedding) FROM items; ``` Average groups of vectors ```sql SELECT category_id, AVG(embedding) FROM items GROUP BY category_id; ``` ## Indexing By default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search, which provides perfect recall. You can add an index to use approximate nearest neighbor search, which trades some recall for speed. Unlike typical indexes, you will see different results for queries after adding an approximate index. Supported index types are: - [HNSW](#hnsw) - added in 0.5.0 - [IVFFlat](#ivfflat) ## HNSW An HNSW index creates a multilayer graph. It has better query performance than IVFFlat (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff), but has slower build times and uses more memory. Also, an index can be created without any data in the table since there isnt a training step like IVFFlat. Add an index for each distance function you want to use. L2 distance ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops); ``` Note: Use `halfvec_l2_ops` for `halfvec` and `sparsevec_l2_ops` for `sparsevec` (and similar with the other distance functions) Inner product ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops); ``` Cosine distance ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops); ``` L1 distance - added in 0.7.0 ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l1_ops); ``` Hamming distance - added in 0.7.0 ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_hamming_ops); ``` Jaccard distance - added in 0.7.0 ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding bit_jaccard_ops); ``` Supported types are: - `vector` - up to 2,000 dimensions - `halfvec` - up to 4,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0) - `bit` - up to 64,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0) - `sparsevec` - up to 1,000 non-zero elements (added in 0.7.0) ### Index Options Specify HNSW parameters - `m` - the max number of connections per layer (16 by default) - `ef_construction` - the size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (64 by default) ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64); ``` A higher value of `ef_construction` provides better recall at the cost of index build time / insert speed. ### Query Options Specify the size of the dynamic candidate list for search (40 by default) ```sql SET hnsw.ef_search = 100; ``` A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed. Use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query ```sql BEGIN; SET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search = 100; SELECT ... COMMIT; ``` ### Index Build Time Indexes build significantly faster when the graph fits into `maintenance_work_mem` ```sql SET maintenance_work_mem = '8GB'; ``` A notice is shown when the graph no longer fits ```text NOTICE: hnsw graph no longer fits into maintenance_work_mem after 100000 tuples DETAIL: Building will take significantly more time. HINT: Increase maintenance_work_mem to speed up builds. ``` Note: Do not set `maintenance_work_mem` so high that it exhausts the memory on the server Like other index types, its faster to create an index after loading your initial data Starting with 0.6.0, you can also speed up index creation by increasing the number of parallel workers (2 by default) ```sql SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader ``` For a large number of workers, you may also need to increase `max_parallel_workers` (8 by default) ### Indexing Progress Check [indexing progress]( with Postgres 12+ ```sql SELECT phase, round(100.0 * blocks_done / nullif(blocks_total, 0), 1) AS ""%"" FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index; ``` The phases for HNSW are: 1. `initializing` 2. `loading tuples` ## IVFFlat An IVFFlat index divides vectors into lists, and then searches a subset of those lists that are closest to the query vector. It has faster build times and uses less memory than HNSW, but has lower query performance (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff). Three keys to achieving good recall are: 1. Create the index *after* the table has some data 2. Choose an appropriate number of lists - a good place to start is `rows / 1000` for up to 1M rows and `sqrt(rows)` for over 1M rows 3. When querying, specify an appropriate number of [probes](#query-options) (higher is better for recall, lower is better for speed) - a good place to start is `sqrt(lists)` Add an index for each distance function you want to use. L2 distance ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100); ``` Note: Use `halfvec_l2_ops` for `halfvec` (and similar with the other distance functions) Inner product ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_ip_ops) WITH (lists = 100); ``` Cosine distance ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100); ``` Hamming distance - added in 0.7.0 ```sql CREATE INDEX ON items USING ivfflat (embedding bit_hamming_ops) WITH (lists = 100); ``` Supported types are: - `vector` - up to 2,000 dimensions - `halfvec` - up to 4,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0) - `bit` - up to 64,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0) ### Query Options Specify the number of probes (1 by default) ```sql SET ivfflat.probes = 10; ``` A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed, and it can be set to the number of lists for exact nearest neighbor search (at which point the planner wont use the index) Use `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction to set it for a single query ```sql BEGIN; SET LOCAL ivfflat.probes = 10; SELECT ... COMMIT; ``` ### Index Build Time Speed up index creation on large tables by increasing the number of parallel workers (2 by default) ```sql SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader ``` For a large number of workers, you may also need to increase `max_parallel_workers` (8 by default) ### Indexing Progress Check [indexing progress]( with Postgres 12+ ```sql SELECT phase, round(1...

However, it has never been intended to be used as a precise benchmark test suite, so do NOT use it in this manner. Running stress-ng with root privileges will adjust out of memory settings on Linux systems to make the stressors unkillable in low memory situations, so use this judiciously. With the appropriate privilege, stress-ng can allow the ionice class and ionice levels to be adjusted, again, this should be used with care. ## Tarballs Tarballs of each version of stress-ng can be downloaded using the URL: where version is the relevant version number, for example: ## Running latest stress-ng snapshot in a container ```bash docker run --rm ghcr.io/colinianking/stress-ng --help ``` or ```bash docker run --rm colinianking/stress-ng --help ``` ## Debian packages for Ubuntu Recent versions of stress-ng are available in the Ubuntu stress-ng ppa for various Ubuntu releases: ``` sudo add-apt-repository ppa:colin-king/stress-ng sudo apt update sudo apt install stress-ng ``` ## Building stress-ng To build, the following libraries will ensure a fully functional stress-ng build: (note libattr is not required for more recent disto releases).

Doing so is strictly against the wishes of the project maintainer and main developer. NOTE: the build will try to detect build dependencies and will build an image with functionality disabled if the support libraries are not installed. At build-time stress-ng will detect kernel features that are available on the target build system and enable stress tests appropriately. Stress-ng has been build-tested on Ubuntu, Debian, Debian GNU/Hurd, Slackware, RHEL, SLES, Centos, kFreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Debian kFreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, OS X, Minix, Solaris 11.3, OpenIndiana and Hiaku. Ports to other POSIX/UNIX like operating systems should be relatively easy. NOTE: ALWAYS run ```make clean``` after fetching changes from the git repository to force the build to regenerate the build configuration file. Parallel builds using make -j are supported. To build on BSD systems, one requires gcc and GNU make: ``` CC=gcc gmake clean CC=gcc gmake ``` To build on OS X systems, just use: ``` make clean make -j ``` To build on MINIX, gmake and clang are required: ``` CC=clang gmake clean CC=clang gmake ``` To build on SunOS, one requires GCC and GNU make, build using: ``` CC=gcc gmake clean CC=gcc gmake ``` To build on Dilos, one requires GCC and GNU make, build using: ``` CC=gcc gmake clean CC=gcc gmake ``` To build on Haiku Alpha 4: ``` make clean make ``` To build a static image (example, for Android), use: ``` make clean STATIC=1 make ``` To build with full warnings enabled: ``` make clean PEDANTIC=1 make ``` To build with the Tiny C compiler: ``` make clean CC=tcc make ``` To build with the PCC portable C compiler use: ``` make clean CC=pcc make ``` To build with the musl C library: ``` make clean CC=musl-gcc ``` To build with the Intel C compiler icc use: ``` make clean CC=icc make ``` To build with the Intel C compiler icx use: ``` make clean CC=icx make ``` To perform a cross-compilation using gcc, use a static build, specify the toolchain (both CC and CXX). For example, a mips64 cross build: ``` make clean STATIC=1 CC=mips64-linux-gnuabi64-gcc CXX=mips64-linux-gnuabi64-g++ make -j $(nproc) ``` To build with debug (-g) enabled use: ``` make clean DEBUG=1 make ``` ## Contributing to stress-ng: Send patches to colin.i.king@gmail.com or merge requests at ## Quick Start Reference Guide The [Ubuntu stress-ng reference guide]( contains a brief overview and worked examples. ## Examples Run 4 CPU, 2 virtual memory, 1 disk and 8 fork stressors for 2 minutes and print measurements: ``` stress-ng --cpu 4 --vm 2 --hdd 1 --fork 8 --timeout 2m --metrics stress-ng: info: [573366] setting to a 120 second (2 mins, 0.00 secs) run per stressor stress-ng: info: [573366] dispatching hogs: 4 cpu, 2 vm, 1 hdd, 8 fork stress-ng: info: [573366] successful run completed in 123.78s (2 mins, 3.78 secs) stress-ng: info: [573366] stressor bogo ops real time usr time sys time bogo ops/s bogo ops/s CPU used per stress-ng: info: [573366] (secs) (secs) (secs) (real time) (usr+sys time) instance (%) stress-ng: info: [573366] cpu 515396 120.00 453.02 0.18 4294.89 1137.24 94.42 stress-ng: info: [573366] vm 2261023 120.01 223.80 1.80 18840.15 10022.27 93.99 stress-ng: info: [573366] hdd 367558 123.78 10.63 11.67 2969.49 16482.42 18.02 stress-ng: info: [573366] fork 598058 120.00 68.24 65.88 4983.80 4459.13 13.97 ``` Run matrix stressor on all online CPUs for 60 seconds and measure temperature: ``` stress-ng --matrix -1 --tz -t 60 stress-ng: info: [1171459] setting to a 60 second run per stressor stress-ng: info: [1171459] dispatching hogs: 8 matrix stress-ng: info: [1171459] successful run completed in 60.01s (1 min, 0.01 secs) stress-ng: info: [1171459] matrix: stress-ng: info: [1171459] acpitz0 75.00 C (348.15 K) stress-ng: info: [1171459] acpitz1 75.00 C (348.15 K) stress-ng: info: [1171459] pch_skylake 60.17 C (333.32 K) stress-ng: info: [1171459] x86_pkg_temp 62.72 C (335.87 K) ``` Run a mix of 4 I/O stressors and check for changes in disk S.M.A.R.T. metadata: ``` sudo stress-ng --iomix 4 --smart -t 30s stress-ng: info: [1171471] setting to a 30 second run per stressor stress-ng: info: [1171471] dispatching hogs: 4 iomix stress-ng: info: [1171471] successful run completed in 30.37s stress-ng: info: [1171471] Device ID S.M.A.R.T.

FreeRTOS-Kernel,FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel,2415,"['C', 'Assembly', 'CMake']",[],"[]( []( ## Getting started This repository contains FreeRTOS kernel source/header files and kernel ports only. This repository is referenced as a submodule in [FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS]( repository, which contains pre-configured demo application projects under ```FreeRTOS/Demo``` directory. The easiest way to use FreeRTOS is to start with one of the pre-configured demo application projects. That way you will have the correct FreeRTOS source files included, and the correct include paths configured. Once a demo application is building and executing you can remove the demo application files, and start to add in your own application source files. See the [FreeRTOS Kernel Quick Start Guide]( for detailed instructions and other useful links. Additionally, for FreeRTOS kernel feature information refer to the [Developer Documentation]( and [API Reference]( Also for contributing and creating a Pull Request please refer to [the instructions here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-via-pull-request). ### Getting help If you have any questions or need assistance troubleshooting your FreeRTOS project, we have an active community that can help on the [FreeRTOS Community Support Forum]( ## To consume FreeRTOS-Kernel ### Consume with CMake If using CMake, it is recommended to use this repository using FetchContent. Add the following into your project's main or a subdirectory's `CMakeLists.txt`: - Define the source and version/tag you want to use: ```cmake FetchContent_Declare( freertos_kernel GIT_REPOSITORY GIT_TAG main #Note: Best practice to use specific git-hash or tagged version ) ``` In case you prefer to add it as a git submodule, do: ```bash git submodule add git submodule update --init ``` - Add a freertos_config library (typically an INTERFACE library) The following assumes the directory structure: - `include/FreeRTOSConfig.h` ```cmake add_library(freertos_config INTERFACE) target_include_directories(freertos_config SYSTEM INTERFACE include ) target_compile_definitions(freertos_config INTERFACE projCOVERAGE_TEST=0 ) ``` In case you installed FreeRTOS-Kernel as a submodule, you will have to add it as a subdirectory: ```cmake add_subdirectory(${FREERTOS_PATH}) ``` - Configure the FreeRTOS-Kernel and make it available - this particular example supports a native and cross-compiled build option. ```cmake set( FREERTOS_HEAP ""4"" CACHE STRING """" FORCE) # Select the native compile PORT set( FREERTOS_PORT ""GCC_POSIX"" CACHE STRING """" FORCE) # Select the cross-compile PORT if (CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) set(FREERTOS_PORT ""GCC_ARM_CA9"" CACHE STRING """" FORCE) endif() FetchContent_MakeAvailable(freertos_kernel) ``` - In case of cross compilation, you should also add the following to `freertos_config`: ```cmake target_compile_definitions(freertos_config INTERFACE ${definitions}) target_compile_options(freertos_config INTERFACE ${options}) ``` ### Consuming stand-alone - Cloning this repository To clone using HTTPS: ``` git clone ``` Using SSH: ``` git clone git@github.com:FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel.git ``` ## Repository structure - The root of this repository contains the three files that are common to every port - list.c, queue.c and tasks.c. The kernel is contained within these three files. croutine.c implements the optional co-routine functionality - which is normally only used on very memory limited systems. - The ```./portable``` directory contains the files that are specific to a particular microcontroller and/or compiler. See the readme file in the ```./portable``` directory for more information. - The ```./include``` directory contains the real time kernel header files. - The ```./template_configuration``` directory contains a sample `FreeRTOSConfig.h` to help jumpstart a new project. See the [FreeRTOSConfig.h](examples/template_configuration/FreeRTOSConfig.h) file for instructions. ### Code Formatting FreeRTOS files are formatted using the ""[uncrustify]( tool. The configuration file used by uncrustify can be found in the [FreeRTOS/CI-CD-GitHub-Actions's]( [uncrustify.cfg]( file. ### Line Endings File checked into the FreeRTOS-Kernel repository use unix-style LF line endings for the best compatibility with git. For optimal compatibility with Microsoft Windows tools, it is best to enable the git autocrlf feature. You can enable this setting for the current repository using the following command: ``` git config core.autocrlf true ``` ### Git History Optimizations Some commits in this repository perform large refactors which touch many lines and lead to unwanted behavior when using the `git blame` command. You can configure git to ignore the list of large refactor commits in this repository with the following command: ``` git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs ``` ### Spelling and Formatting We recommend using [Visual Studio Code]( commonly referred to as VSCode, when working on the FreeRTOS-Kernel. The FreeRTOS-Kernel also uses [cSpell]( as part of its spelling check. The config file for which can be found at [cspell.config.yaml](cspell.config.yaml) There is additionally a [cSpell plugin for VSCode]( that can be used as well. *[.cSpellWords.txt](.github/.cSpellWords.txt)* contains words that are not traditionally found in an English dictionary. It is used by the spellchecker to verify the various jargon, variable names, and other odd words used in the FreeRTOS code base are correct. If your pull request fails to pass the spelling and you believe this is a mistake, then add the word to *[.cSpellWords.txt](.github/.cSpellWords.txt)*. When adding a word please then sort the list, which can be done by running the bash command: `sort -u .cSpellWords.txt -o .cSpellWords.txt` Note that only the FreeRTOS-Kernel Source Files, [include](include), [portable/MemMang](portable/MemMang), and [portable/Common](portable/Common) files are checked for proper spelling, and formatting at this time.","1k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, enhancement, bug, roadmap, help wanted, documentation, wontfix, question, invalid, good first issue, duplicate, Triaged, Testing In-Progress, Testing Complete, Second Code Review In-Progress, Second Code Review Complete, Reviewers Assigned, New Port, First Code Review In-Progress, First Code Review Complete, Concept Nack, Concept Ack"

The current HTML5 pages are written by Daiyuu Nobori (the core developer of SoftEther VPN). He is obviously lack of HTML5 development ability. Please kindly consider to contribute for SoftEther VPN's development on GitHub. Your code will help every people running SoftEther VPN Server. ## Built-in SoftEther Server VPN JSON-RPC API Suite The API Suite allows you to easily develop your original SoftEther VPN Server management application to control the VPN Server (e.g. creating users, adding Virtual Hubs, disconnecting a specified VPN sessions). You can access to the [latest SoftEther VPN Server JSON-RPC Document on GitHub.]( - Almost all control APIs, which the VPN Server provides, are available as JSON-RPC API. You can write your own VPN Server management application in your favorite languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, C#, ... etc.) - If you are planning to develop your own VPN cloud service, the JSON-RPC API is the best choice to realize the automated operations for the VPN Server. - No need to use any specific API client library since all APIs are provided on the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification. You can use your favorite JSON and HTTPS client library to call any of all APIs in your pure runtime environment. - Also, the SoftEther VPN Project provides high-quality JSON-RPC client stub libraries which define all of the API client stub codes. These libraries are written in C#, JavaScript and TypeScript. The Node.js Client Library for VPN Server RPC (vpnrpc) package is also available. # TO CIRCUMVENT YOUR GOVERNMENT'S FIREWALL RESTRICTION Because SoftEther VPN is overly strong tool to build a VPN tunnel, some censorship governments want to block your access to the source code of SoftEther VPN, by abusing their censorship firewalls. To circumvent your censor's unjust restriction, SoftEther VPN Project distributes the up-to-date source code on all the following open-source repositories: - GitHub $ git clone - GitLab (mirrored from GitHub) $ git clone - OneDev (mirrored from GitHub) $ git clone We hope that you can reach one of the above URLs at least! # SOURCE CODE CONTRIBUTION Your contribution to SoftEther VPN Project is much appreciated.

whisper.cpp,ggerganov/whisper.cpp,32018,"['C', 'C++', 'Cuda']","['openai', 'speech-to-text', 'transformer', 'whisper', 'inference']","# whisper.cpp []( []( []( Stable: [v1.6.2]( / [Roadmap | F.A.Q.]( High-performance inference of [OpenAI's Whisper]( automatic speech recognition (ASR) model: - Plain C/C++ implementation without dependencies - Apple Silicon first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate framework, Metal and [Core ML]( - AVX intrinsics support for x86 architectures - VSX intrinsics support for POWER architectures - Mixed F16 / F32 precision - [4-bit and 5-bit integer quantization support]( - Zero memory allocations at runtime - Support for CPU-only inference - [Efficient GPU support for NVIDIA]( - [Partial OpenCL GPU support via CLBlast]( - [OpenVINO Support]( - [C-style API]( Supported platforms: - [x] Mac OS (Intel and Arm) - [x] [iOS](examples/whisper.objc) - [x] [Android](examples/whisper.android) - [x] [Java](bindings/java/README.md) - [x] Linux / [FreeBSD]( - [x] [WebAssembly](examples/whisper.wasm) - [x] Windows ([MSVC]( and [MinGW]( - [x] [Raspberry Pi]( - [x] [docker]( The entire high-level implementation of the model is contained in [whisper.h](whisper.h) and [whisper.cpp](whisper.cpp). The rest of the code is part of the [`ggml`]( machine learning library. Having such a lightweight implementation of the model allows to easily integrate it in different platforms and applications. As an example, here is a video of running the model on an iPhone 13 device - fully offline, on-device: [whisper.objc](examples/whisper.objc) You can also easily make your own offline voice assistant application: [command](examples/command) On Apple Silicon, the inference runs fully on the GPU via Metal: Or you can even run it straight in the browser: [talk.wasm](examples/talk.wasm) ## Implementation details - The core tensor operations are implemented in C ([ggml.h](ggml.h) / [ggml.c](ggml.c)) - The transformer model and the high-level C-style API are implemented in C++ ([whisper.h](whisper.h) / [whisper.cpp](whisper.cpp)) - Sample usage is demonstrated in [main.cpp](examples/main) - Sample real-time audio transcription from the microphone is demonstrated in [stream.cpp](examples/stream) - Various other examples are available in the [examples](examples) folder The tensor operators are optimized heavily for Apple silicon CPUs. Depending on the computation size, Arm Neon SIMD intrinsics or CBLAS Accelerate framework routines are used. The latter are especially effective for bigger sizes since the Accelerate framework utilizes the special-purpose AMX coprocessor available in modern Apple products. ## Quick start First clone the repository: ```bash git clone ``` Then, download one of the Whisper [models](models/README.md) converted in [`ggml` format](#ggml-format).

For detailed usage instructions, run: `./main -h` Note that the [main](examples/main) example currently runs only with 16-bit WAV files, so make sure to convert your input before running the tool. For example, you can use `ffmpeg` like this: ```bash ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav ``` ## More audio samples If you want some extra audio samples to play with, simply run: ``` make samples ``` This will download a few more audio files from Wikipedia and convert them to 16-bit WAV format via `ffmpeg`. You can download and run the other models as follows: ``` make tiny.en make tiny make base.en make base make small.en make small make medium.en make medium make large-v1 make large-v2 make large-v3 ``` ## Memory usage | Model | Disk | Mem | | ------ | ------- | ------- | | tiny | 75 MiB | ~273 MB | | base | 142 MiB | ~388 MB | | small | 466 MiB | ~852 MB | | medium | 1.5 GiB | ~2.1 GB | | large | 2.9 GiB | ~3.9 GB | ## Quantization `whisper.cpp` supports integer quantization of the Whisper `ggml` models. Quantized models require less memory and disk space and depending on the hardware can be processed more efficiently. Here are the steps for creating and using a quantized model: ```bash # quantize a model with Q5_0 method make quantize ./quantize models/ggml-base.en.bin models/ggml-base.en-q5_0.bin q5_0 # run the examples as usual, specifying the quantized model file ./main -m models/ggml-base.en-q5_0.bin ./samples/gb0.wav ``` ## Core ML support On Apple Silicon devices, the Encoder inference can be executed on the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) via Core ML. This can result in significant speed-up - more than x...

TFT_eSPI,Bodmer/TFT_eSPI,3423,"['C', 'C++', 'Processing']","['arduino-library', 'tft', 'arduino', 'stm32', 'esp32']","A [""Discussions""]( facility has been added for Q&A etc. Use the [""Issues""]( tab only for problems with the library. Thanks! # News 1. The Create_font Processing sketch has been updated to automatically create a complete C header file. The automatic opening of the font folder can also be disabled within the Processing sketch. (Thanks to Pierre-Loup Martin). 2. New board setup files have been added for the Seeed XIAO with round display, LilyGo T-Embed S3, LilyGo_T_QT_Pro_S3, ESP32 S3 Box and ESP32_S3_Box_Lite. The ""RPi"" interface style boards are now supported with the ESP32 S3. 3. New functions have been added to draw smooth (antialiased) arcs, circles, and rounded rectangle outlines. New sketches are provided in the ""Smooth Graphics"" examples folder. Arcs can be drawn with or without anti-aliasing (which will then render faster). The arc ends can be straight or rounded. The arc drawing algorithm uses an optimised fixed point sqrt() function to improve performance on processors that do not have a hardware Floating Point Unit (e.g. RP2040). Here are two demo images, on the left smooth (anti-aliased) arcs with rounded ends, the image to the right is the same resolution (grabbed from the same 240x240 TFT) with the smoothing diasbled (no anti-aliasing): Here the smooth arcs have been used to create anti-aliased meter gauges on a 320x240 TFT: 4. An excellent new compatible library is available which can render TrueType fonts on a TFT screen (or into a sprite). This has been developed by [takkaO]( The library provides access to compact font files, with fully scaleable anti-aliased glyphs. Left, middle and right justified text can also be printed to the screen. I have added TFT_eSPI specific examples to the OpenFontRender library and tested on RP2040 and ESP32 processors, the ESP8266 does not have sufficient RAM due to the glyph render complexity. Here is a demo screen where a single 12kbyte font file binary was used to render fully anti-aliased glyphs of gradually increasing size on a 320x480 TFT screen: 5. New GUI examples have been added for sliders, buttons, graphs and meters. These examples require a new support library here: [TFT_eWidget]( 6. Support has been added in v2.4.70 for the RP2040 with 16-bit parallel displays. This has been tested and the screen update performance is very good (4ms to clear 320 x 480 screen with HC8357C). The use of the RP2040 PIO makes it easy to change the write cycle timing for different displays. DMA with 16-bit transfers is also supported. 7. Support for the ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C3 has been added (DMA only on ESP32 S3 at the moment). Tested with v2.0.3 RC1 of the ESP32 board package. Example setups: [Setup70_ESP32_S2_ILI9341.h]( [Setup70b_ESP32_S3_ILI9341.h]( [Setup70c_ESP32_C3_ILI9341.h]( [Setup70d_ILI9488_S3_Parallel.h]( 8. Smooth fonts can now be rendered direct to the TFT with very little flicker for quickly changing values. This is achieved by a line-by-line and block-by-block update of the glyph area without drawing pixels twice. This is a ""breaking"" change for some sketches because a new true/false parameter is needed to render the background. The default is false if the parameter is missing, Examples: tft.setTextColor(TFT_WHITE, TFT_BLUE, true); spr.setTextColor(TFT_BLUE, TFT_BLACK, true); Note: background rendering for Smooth fonts is also now available when using the print stream e.g. with: tft.println(""Hello World""); 9. New anti-aliased graphics functions to draw lines, wedge shaped lines, circles and rounded rectangles. [Examples are included]( Examples have also been added to [display PNG compressed images]( (note: requires ~40kbytes RAM). 10. Users of PowerPoint experienced with running macros may be interested in the [pptm sketch generator here]( this converts graphics and tables drawn in PowerPoint slides into an Arduino sketch that renders the graphics on a 480x320 TFT. This is based on VB macros [created by Kris Kasprzak here]( 11. The library contains two new functions for rectangles filled with a horizontal or vertical coloured gradient: tft.fillRectHGradient(x, y, w, h, color1, color2); tft.fillRectVGradient(x, y, w, h, color1, color2); 12. The RP2040 8-bit parallel interface uses the PIO. The PIO now manages the ""setWindow"" and ""block fill"" actions, releasing the processor for other tasks when areas of the screen are being filled with a colour. The PIO can optionally be used for SPI interface displays if #define RP2040_PIO_SPI is put in the setup file. Touch screens and pixel read operations are not supported when the PIO interface is used. The RP2040 PIO features only work with [Earle Philhower's board package]( NOT the Arduino Mbed version. The use of PIO for SPI allows the RP2040 to be over-clocked (up to 250MHz works on my boards) in Earle's board package whilst still maintaining high SPI clock rates. # TFT_eSPI A feature rich Arduino IDE compatible graphics and fonts library for 32-bit processors. The library is targeted at 32-bit processors, it has been performance optimised for RP2040, STM32, ESP8266 and ESP32 types, other 32-bit processors may be used but will use the slower generic Arduino interface calls. The library can be loaded using the Arduino IDE's Library Manager. Direct Memory Access (DMA) can be used with the ESP32, RP2040 and STM32 processors with SPI interface displays to improve rendering performance. DMA with a parallel interface (8 and 16-bit) is only supported with the RP2040. The updates for the ESP32 S2/C3/S3 means that the library requires the ESP32 Arduino board package 2.x.x or later. The screen controller, interface pins and library configuration settings must be defined inside the library. They can NOT be defined in the Arduino sketch. See the User_Setup_Select.h file for details. This approach has significant advantages, it keeps the examples clean from long configuration options and once the setup is defined any example can be run without modification. PlatformIO users can define these settings on a per project basis within a platformio.ini file, see Docs folder in library. Lots of example sketches are provided which demonstrate using the functions in the library. Due to the popularity of the library there are lots of online tutorials for TFT_eSPI that have been created by enthusiastic users. Optimised drivers have been tested with the following processors: * RP2040, e.g. Raspberry Pi Pico * ESP32 and ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3 * ESP8266 * STM32F1xx, STM32F2xx, STM32F4xx, STM32F767 (higher RAM processors recommended) The library supports the following interface types for these processors: | Processor | 4 wire SPI | 8-bit parallel | 16-bit parallel | DMA support | |-----------| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | | RP2040 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (all) | | ESP32 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes (SPI only) | | ESP32 C3 | Yes | No | No | No | | ESP32 S2 | Yes | No | No | No | | ESP32 S3 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes (SPI only) | | ESP8266 | Yes | No | No | No | | STM32Fxxx | Yes | Yes | No | Yes (SPI only) | | Other | Yes | No | No | No | For other (generic) processors only SPI interface displays are supported and the slower Arduino SPI library functions are used by the library. Higher clock speed processors such as used for the Teensy 3.x and 4.x boards will still provide a very good performance with the generic Arduino SPI functions. 4 wire SPI means the display must have SPI interface comaptible signals and a ""Data/Command"" control signal, this signal line is sometimes labelled DC, RS or A0. Due to lack of GPIO pins the 8-bit parallel interface is NOT supported on the ESP8266. 8-bit parallel interface TFTs (e.g. UNO format mcufriend shields) can used with the STM32Fxxx Nucleo 64/144 range or the UNO format ESP32 (see below for ESP32). Support for the XPT2046 touch screen controller is built into the library and can be used with SPI interface displays. Third party touch support libraries are also available when using a display parallel interface. Displays using the following controllers are supported: * GC9A01 * ILI9163 * ILI9225 * ILI9341 * ILI9342 * ILI9481 (DMA not supported with SPI) * ILI9486 (DMA not supported with SPI) * ILI9488 (DMA not supported with SPI) * HX8357B (16-bit parallel tested with RP2040) * HX8357C (16-bit parallel tested with RP2040) * HX8357D * R61581 * RM68120 (support files added but untested) * RM68140 * S6D02A1 * SSD1351 * SSD1963 (this controller only has a parallel interface option) * ST7735 * ST7789 * ST7796 ILI9341 and ST7796 SPI based displays are recommended as starting point for experimenting with this library. The library supports some TFT displays designed for the Raspberry Pi (RPi) that are based on a ILI9486 or ST7796 driver chip with a 480 x 320 pixel screen. The ILI9486 RPi display must be of the Waveshare design and use a 16-bit serial interface based on the 74HC04, 74HC4040 and 2 x 74HC4094 logic chips. Note that due to design variations between these displays not all RPi displays will work with this library, so purchasing a RPi display of these types solely for use with this library is NOT recommended. A ""good"" RPi display is the [MHS-4.0 inch Display-B type ST7796]( which provides good performance. This has a dedicated controller and can be clocked at up to 80MHz with the ESP32 (125MHz with overclocked RP2040, 55MHz with STM32 and 40MHz with ESP8266). The [MHS-3.5 inch RPi ILI9486]( based display is also supported, however the MHS ILI9341 based display of the same type does NOT work with this library. Some displays permit the internal TFT screen RAM to be read, a few of the examples use this feature. The TFT_Screen_Capture example allows full screens to be captured and sent to a PC, this is handy to create program documentation. The library includes a ""Sprite"" class, this enables flicker free updates of complex graphics. Direct writes to the TFT with graphics functions are still available, so existing sketches do not need to be changed. # Sprites A Sprite is notionally an invisible graphics s...

Usage](#6-usage) - [6.1 Gaming](#61-gaming) - [7. Integration](#7-integration) ## 1. Project Description ### 1.1 What Is This? Labwc stands for Lab Wayland Compositor, where lab can mean any of the following: - sense of experimentation and treading new ground - inspired by BunsenLabs and ArchLabs - your favorite pet Labwc is a [wlroots]-based window-stacking compositor for [wayland], inspired by [openbox]. It is light-weight and independent with a focus on simply stacking windows well and rendering some window decorations. It takes a no-bling/frills approach and says no to features such as animations. It relies on clients for panels, screenshots, wallpapers and so on to create a full desktop environment. Labwc tries to stay in keeping with [wlroots] and [sway] in terms of general approach and coding style. Labwc has no reliance on any particular Desktop Environment, Desktop Shell or session. Nor does it depend on any UI toolkits such as Qt or GTK. ### 1.2 Why? Firstly, we believe that there is a need for a simple Wayland window-stacking compositor which strikes a balance between minimalism and bloat approximately at the level where Window Managers like Openbox reside in the X11 domain. Most of the core developers are accustomed to low resource Desktop Environments such as Mate/XFCE or standalone Window Managers such as Openbox under X11. Labwc aims to make a similar setup possible under Wayland, with small and independent components rather than a large, integrated software eco-system. Secondly, the Wayland community has achieved an amazing amount so far, and we want to help solve the unsolved problems to make Wayland viable for more people. We think that standardisation and de-fragmentation is a route to greater Wayland adoption, and wanting to play our part in this, Labwc only understands [wayland-protocols] & [wlr-protocols], and it cannot be controlled with dbus, sway/i3/custom-IPC or other technology. Thirdly, it is important to us that scope is tightly controlled so that the compositor matures to production quality. On the whole, we value robustness, reliability, stability and simplicity over new features. Coming up with new ideas and features is easy - maintaining and stabilising them is not. Fourthly, we are of the view that a compositor should be boring in order to do its job well. In this regard we follow in the footsteps of [metacity] which describes itself as a ""Boring window manager for the adult in you. Many window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like Cheerios."" Finally, we think that an elegant solution to all of this does not need feel square and pixelated like something out of the 1990s, but should look contemporary and enable cutting-edge performance. ### 1.3 Why The Openbox Theme Specification? In order to avoid reinventing configuration and theme syntaxes, the [openbox] 3.6 specification is used. This does not mean that labwc is an openbox clone but rather that configuration files will look and feel familiar. Also, parsing GTK3+ and Qt themes for window decorations is very complicated, so using much simpler specs such as those used by openbox and xfwm makes sense for a compositor such as labwc, both in terms of implementation and for user modification. Openbox spec is somewhat of a stable standard considering how long it has remained unchanged for and how wide-spread its adoption is by lightweight distributions such as LXDE, LXQt, BunsenLabs, ArchLabs, Mabox and Raspbian. Some widely used themes (for example Numix and Arc) have built-in support. We could have invented a whole new syntax, but that's not where we want to spend our effort. ### 1.4 Very High Level Scope A lot of emphasis is put on code simplicity when considering features. The main development effort is focused on producing a solid foundation for a stacking compositor rather than adding configuration and theming options. See [scope] for full details on implemented features. High-level summary of items that Labwc supports: - [x] Config files (rc.xml, autostart, environment, menu.xml) - [x] Theme files and xbm/png/svg icons - [x] Basic desktop and client menus - [x] HiDPI - [x] wlroots protocols such as `output-management`, `layer-shell` and `foreign-toplevel` - [x] Optionally xwayland ### 1.5 Videos | video link | date | duration | ------------------------- | ------------| ------- | [0.7.2-release-video] | 24-May-2024 | 3:17 | [0.6.0-release-video] | 31-Oct-2022 | 2:48 | [0.3.0-release-video] | 05-Aug-2021 | 1:10 | [pre-0.1.0-release-video] | 25-Feb-2021 | 3:42 [0.7.2-release-video]: [0.6.0-release-video]: [0.3.0-release-video]: [pre-0.1.0-release-video]: ### 1.6 Screenshot The obligatory screenshot: Screenshot description ## 2. Build and Installation To build, simply run: meson setup build/ meson compile -C build/ Run-time dependencies include: - wlroots, wayland, libinput, xkbcommon - libxml2, cairo, pango, glib-2.0 - libpng - librsvg >=2.46 (optional) - xwayland, xcb (optional) Build dependencies include: - meson, ninja, gcc/clang - wayland-protocols Disable xwayland with `meson -Dxwayland=disabled build/` For OS/distribution specific details see [wiki]. If the right version of `wlroots` is not found on the system, the build setup will automatically download the wlroots repo. If this fallback is not desired please use: meson setup --wrap-mode=nodownload build/ To enforce the supplied wlroots.wrap file, run: meson setup --force-fallback-for=wlroots build/ If installing after using the wlroots.wrap file, use the following to prevent installing the wlroots headers: meson install --skip-subprojects -C build/ ## 3. Configuration User config files are located at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config/labwc/}` with the following five files being used: [rc.xml], [menu.xml], [autostart], [environment] and [themerc-override]. Run `labwc --reconfigure` to reload configuration and theme. For a step-by-step initial configuration guide, see [getting-started]. ## 4. Theming Themes are located at `~/.local/share/themes/\/openbox-3/` or equivalent `XDG_DATA_{DIRS,HOME}` location in accordance with freedesktop XDG directory specification. For full theme options, see [labwc-theme(5)] or the [themerc] example file. For themes, search the internet for ""openbox themes"" and place them in `~/.local/share/themes/`. Some good starting points include: - - - - ## 5. Translations The default window bar menu can be translated on the [weblate platform]( ## 6. Usage ./build/labwc [-s ] > **_NOTE:_** If you are running on **NVIDIA**, you will need the > `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` kernel parameter.

Note that this is only one of many projects under the Jellyfin GitHub [organization]( on GitHub. If you want to contribute, you can start by checking out our [documentation]( to see what to work on. ## Server Development These instructions will help you get set up with a local development environment in order to contribute to this repository. Before you start, please be sure to completely read our [guidelines on development contributions]( Note that this project is supported on all major operating systems except FreeBSD, which is still incompatible. ### Prerequisites Before the project can be built, you must first install the [.NET 8.0 SDK]( on your system. Instructions to run this project from the command line are included here, but you will also need to install an IDE if you want to debug the server while it is running. Any IDE that supports .NET 6 development will work, but two options are recent versions of [Visual Studio]( (at least 2022) and [Visual Studio Code]( [ffmpeg]( will also need to be installed. ### Cloning the Repository After dependencies are installed you will need to clone a local copy of this repository. If you just want to run the server from source you can clone this repository directly, but if you are intending to contribute code changes to the project, you should [set up your own fork]( of the repository. The following example shows how you can clone the repository directly over HTTPS. ```bash git clone ``` ### Installing the Web Client The server is configured to host the static files required for the [web client]( in addition to serving the backend by default. Before you can run the server, you will need to get a copy of the web client since they are not included in this repository directly. Note that it is also possible to [host the web client separately](#hosting-the-web-client-separately) from the web server with some additional configuration, in which case you can skip this step. There are three options to get the files for the web client. 1. Download one of the finished builds from the [Azure DevOps pipeline]( You can download the build for a specific release by looking at the [branches tab]( of the pipelines page. 2. Build them from source following the instructions on the [jellyfin-web repository]( 3. Get the pre-built files from an existing installation of the server. For example, with a Windows server installation the client files are located at `C:\Program Files\Jellyfin\Server\jellyfin-web` ### Running The Server The following instructions will help you get the project up and running via the command line, or your preferred IDE. #### Running With Visual Studio To run the project with Visual Studio you can open the Solution (`.sln`) file and then press `F5` to run the server. #### Running With Visual Studio Code To run the project with Visual Studio Code you will first need to open the repository directory with Visual Studio Code using the `Open Folder...` option. Second, you need to [install the recommended extensions for the workspace]( Note that extension recommendations are classified as either ""Workspace Recommendations"" or ""Other Recommendations"", but only the ""Workspace Recommendations"" are required. After the required extensions are installed, you can run the server by pressing `F5`. #### Running From The Command Line To run the server from the command line you can use the `dotnet run` command. The example below shows how to do this if you have cloned the repository into a directory named `jellyfin` (the default directory name) and should work on all operating systems. ```bash cd jellyfin # Move into the repository directory dotnet run --project Jellyfin.Server --webdir /absolute/path/to/jellyfin-web/dist # Run the server startup project ``` A second option is to build the project and then run the resulting executable file directly. When running the executable directly you can easily add command line options. Add the `--help` flag to list details on all the supported command line options. 1. Build the project ```bash dotnet build # Build the project cd Jellyfin.Server/bin/Debug/net8.0 # Change into the build output directory ``` 2. Execute the build output. On Linux, Mac, etc. use `./jellyfin` and on Windows use `jellyfin.exe`. #### Accessing the Hosted Web Client If the Server is configured to host the Web Client, and the Server is running, the Web Client can be accessed at ` by default. API documentation can be viewed at ` ### Running from GH-Codespaces As Jellyfin will run on a container on a github hosted server, JF needs to handle some things differently. **NOTE:** Depending on the selected configuration (if you just click 'create codespace' it will create a default configuration one) it might take 20-30 seconds to load all extensions and prepare the environment while VS Code is already open. Just give it some time and wait until you see `Downloading .NET version(s) 7.0.15~x64 ...... Done!` in the output tab. **NOTE:** If you want to access the JF instance from outside, like with a WebClient on another PC, remember to set the ""ports"" in the lower VS Code window to public. **NOTE:** When first opening the server instance with any WebUI, you will be sent to the login instead of the setup page. Refresh the login page once and you should be redirected to the Setup. There are two configurations for you to choose from. #### Default - Development Jellyfin Server This creates a container that has everything to run and debug the Jellyfin Media server but does not setup anything else. Each time you create a new container you have to run through the whole setup again. There is also no ffmpeg, webclient or media preloaded. Use the `.NET Launch (nowebclient)` launch config to start the server. > Keep in mind that as this has no web client you have to connect to it via an external client. This can be just another codespace container running the WebUI. vuejs does not work from the get-go as it does not support the setup steps. #### Development Jellyfin Server ffmpeg this extends the default server with a default installation of ffmpeg6 though the means described here: If you want to install a specific ffmpeg version, follow the comments embedded in the `.devcontainer/Dev - Server Ffmpeg/install.ffmpeg.sh` file. Use the `ghcs .NET Launch (nowebclient, ffmpeg)` launch config to run with the jellyfin-ffmpeg enabled. ### Running The Tests This repository also includes unit tests that are used to validate functionality as part of a CI pipeline on Azure. There are several ways to run these tests. 1. Run tests from the command line using `dotnet test` 2. Run tests in Visual Studio using the [Test Explorer]( 3. Run individual tests in Visual Studio Code using the associated [CodeLens annotation]( ### Advanced Configuration The following sections describe some more advanced scenarios for running the server from source that build upon the standard instructions above. #### Hosting The Web Client Separately It is not necessary to host the frontend web client as part of the backend server. Hosting these two components separately may be useful for frontend developers who would prefer to host the client in a separate webpack development server for a tighter development loop. See the [jellyfin-web]( repo for instructions on how to do this. To instruct the server not to host the web content, there is a `nowebclient` configuration flag that must be set. This can specified using the command line switch `--nowebclient` or the environment variable `JELLYFIN_NOWEBCONTENT=true`. Since this is a common scenario, there is also a separate launch profile defined for Visual Studio called `Jellyfin.Server (nowebcontent)` that can be selected from the 'Start Debugging' dropdown in the main toolbar. **NOTE:** The setup wizard can not be run if the web client is hosted separately. --- This project is supported by:","2.8k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, bug, confirmed, enhancement, merge conflict, backend, stale, media playback, needs testing, live-tv, feature, blocked, security, regression, good first issue, ui & ux, dependencies, stable backport, nuget, area:database, upstream, syncplay, question, librarydb, build, help wanted, github-actions, discussion needed, ci, awaiting-feedback, support"

The following example shows how to receive HTTP requests and send an email in response: ```csharp public class SendEmailWorkflow : WorkflowBase { protected override void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder) { builder.Root = new Sequence { Activities = { new HttpEndpoint { Path = new(""/send-email""), SupportedMethods = new(new[] { HttpMethods.Post }), CanStartWorkflow = true }, new SendEmail { From = new(""alic@acme.com""), To = new(new[]{ ""bob@acme.com"" }), Subject = new(""Your workflow has been triggered!""), Body = new(""Hello!"") } } }; } } ``` ## Designed Workflows Elsa allows you to define workflows using a visual designer. The following example shows how to receive HTTP requests and send an email in response: ## Contributing We welcome contributions from the community and are pleased that you are interested in helping to improve the Elsa Workflow project! Here are the steps to contribute to our project: ### 1. Fork and Clone the Repo To get started, you'll need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. You can do this by navigating to the [Elsa Workflow GitHub repository]( and clicking the ""Fork"" button in the top-right corner of the page. Once you have forked the repo, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command: ```bash git clone ``` Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username. For more information on forking a repo, check out the GitHub documentation [here]( Incorporating the details about the ""bundles"" folder and its projects into the second point about opening the `Elsa.sln` using your favorite IDE, we can expand the instructions to guide developers on where to start and what projects they might want to explore first. Here's an updated version of that section with the additional information: ### 2. Open `Elsa.sln` Using Your Favorite IDE After cloning the repository, navigate to the cloned directory and open the `Elsa.sln` solution file with your preferred IDE that supports .NET development, such as Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, or Visual Studio Code with the appropriate extensions. Within the solution, you will find a ""bundles"" folder containing three projects designed to help you get started and explore the capabilities of Elsa Workflow: - **Elsa.Server.Web**: This project is a reference ASP.NET Core application that acts as a workflow server. It's a great starting point if you want to understand how Elsa functions as a server-side workflow engine. - **Elsa.ServerAndStudio.Web**: This project serves a dual purpose. Like `Elsa.Server.Web`, it acts as a workflow server. Additionally, it hosts the Elsa Studio Blazor WebAssembly app. This is the perfect project to run if you want to see the full capabilities of Elsa, including both the server aspects and the client-side studio experience in one application. - **Elsa.Studio.Web**: This project is a reference Blazor WebAssembly application that solely hosts the Elsa Studio Blazor WebAssembly app. It requires a running Elsa server application to connect to. Use this project if you're interested in focusing on the Elsa Studio UI and its interactions with an Elsa workflow server. ### 3. Submit a PR with Your Changes Once you have made your changes, commit them and push them back to your fork. Then, navigate to the original Elsa Workflow repository and create a new Pull Request.

DnsServer,TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer,3676,"['C#', 'JavaScript', 'HTML']","['dns-server', 'privacy', 'dns-over-https', 'dns-over-tls', 'dns']","Technitium DNS Server Self host a DNS server for privacy & security Block ads & malware at DNS level for your entire network! Technitium DNS Server is an open source authoritative as well as recursive DNS server that can be used for self hosting a DNS server for privacy & security. It works out-of-the-box with no or minimal configuration and provides a user friendly web console accessible using any modern web browser. Nobody really bothers about domain name resolution since it works automatically behind the scenes and is complex to understand. Most computer software use the operating system's DNS resolver that usually query the configured ISP's DNS server using UDP protocol. This way works well for most people but, your ISP can see and control what website you can visit even when the website employ HTTPS security. Not only that, some ISPs can redirect, block or inject content into websites you visit even when you use a different DNS provider like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS. Having Technitium DNS Server configured to use [DNS-over-TLS]( [DNS-over-HTTPS]( or [DNS-over-QUIC]( forwarders, these privacy & security issues can be mitigated very effectively. Be it a home network or an organization's network, having a locally running DNS server gives you more insights into your network and helps to understand it better using the DNS logs and stats. It improves overall performance since most queries are served from the DNS cache making web sites load faster by not having to wait for frequent DNS resolutions. It also gives you an additional control over your network allowing you to block domain names network wide and also allows you to route your DNS traffic securely using encrypted DNS protocols. # Sponsored By # Features - Works on Windows, Linux, macOS and Raspberry Pi. - Docker image available on [Docker Hub]( - Installs in just a minute and works out-of-the-box with zero configuration. - Block ads & malware using one or more block list URLs. - High performance DNS server based on async IO that can serve millions of requests per minute even on a commodity desktop PC hardware (load tested on Intel i7-8700 CPU with more than 100,000 request/second over Gigabit Ethernet). - Self host [DNS-over-TLS]( [DNS-over-HTTPS]( and [DNS-over-QUIC]( DNS services on your network. - DNS-over-HTTPS implementation supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 transport protocols. - Supports DNS over [PROXY protocol]( version 1 and 2 for both UDP and TCP transports. - Use public DNS resolvers like Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, and AdGuard with [DNS-over-TLS]( [DNS-over-HTTPS]( or [DNS-over-QUIC]( protocols as forwarders. - Advanced caching with features like serve stale, prefetching and auto prefetching. - Persistent caching feature that saves cache to disk when DNS server restarts. - DNS rebinding attack protection feature available with DNS Rebinding Protection App. - Supports working as an authoritative as well as a recursive DNS server. - DNSSEC validation support with RSA & ECDSA algorithms for recursive resolver, forwarders, and conditional forwarders with NSEC and NSEC3 support. - DNSSEC support for all supported DNS transport protocols including encrypted DNS protocols. - DANE TLSA [RFC 6698]( record type support.

Ryujinx,Ryujinx/Ryujinx,32800,"['C#', 'GLSL', 'C']","['emulator', 'csharp', 'switch', 'emulation', 'dotnet-core']","Ryujinx (REE-YOU-JINX) Ryujinx is an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, created by gdkchan, written in C#. This emulator aims at providing excellent accuracy and performance, a user-friendly interface and consistent builds. It was written from scratch and development on the project began in September 2017. Ryujinx is available on Github under the MIT license. ## Compatibility As of May 2024, Ryujinx has been tested on approximately 4,300 titles; over 4,100 boot past menus and into gameplay, with roughly 3,550 of those being considered playable. You can check out the compatibility list [here]( Anyone is free to submit a new game test or update an existing game test entry; simply follow the new issue template and testing guidelines, or post as a reply to the applicable game issue. Use the search function to see if a game has been tested already! ## Usage To run this emulator, your PC must be equipped with at least 8GiB of RAM; failing to meet this requirement may result in a poor gameplay experience or unexpected crashes. See our [Setup & Configuration Guide]( on how to set up the emulator. For our Local Wireless (LDN) builds, see our [Multiplayer: Local Play/Local Wireless Guide ]( Avalonia UI comes with translations for various languages. See [Crowdin]( for more information. ## Latest build These builds are compiled automatically for each commit on the master branch. While we strive to ensure optimal stability and performance prior to pushing an update, our automated builds **may be unstable or completely broken**. If you want to see details on updates to the emulator, you can visit our [Changelog]( The latest automatic build for Windows, macOS, and Linux can be found on the [Official Website]( ## Documentation If you are planning to contribute or just want to learn more about this project please read through our [documentation](docs/README.md). ## Building If you wish to build the emulator yourself, follow these steps: ### Step 1 Install the [.NET 8.0 (or higher) SDK]( Make sure your SDK version is higher or equal to the required version specified in [global.json](global.json). ### Step 2 Either use `git clone on the command line to clone the repository or use Code --> Download zip button to get the files. ### Step 3 To build Ryujinx, open a command prompt inside the project directory. You can quickly access it on Windows by holding shift in File Explorer, then right clicking and selecting `Open command window here`. Then type the following command: `dotnet build -c Release -o build` the built files will be found in the newly created build directory. Ryujinx system files are stored in the `Ryujinx` folder. This folder is located in the user folder, which can be accessed by clicking `Open Ryujinx Folder` under the File menu in the GUI. ## Features - **Audio** Audio output is entirely supported, audio input (microphone) isn't supported. We use C# wrappers for [OpenAL]( and [SDL2]( & [libsoundio]( as fallbacks. - **CPU** The CPU emulator, ARMeilleure, emulates an ARMv8 CPU and currently has support for most 64-bit ARMv8 and some of the ARMv7 (and older) instructions, including partial 32-bit support. It translates the ARM code to a custom IR, performs a few optimizations, and turns that into x86 code. There are three memory manager options available depending on the user's preference, leveraging both software-based (slower) and host-mapped modes (much faster). The fastest option (host, unchecked) is set by default. Ryujinx also features an optional Profiled Persistent Translation Cache, which essentially caches translated functions so that they do not need to be translated every time the game loads. The net result is a significant reduction in load times (the amount of time between launching a game and arriving at the title screen) for nearly every game. NOTE: This feature is enabled by default in the Options menu > System tab. You must launch the game at least twice to the title screen or beyond before performance improvements are unlocked on the third launch! These improvements are permanent and do not require any extra launches going forward. - **GPU** The GPU emulator emulates the Switch's Maxwell GPU using either the OpenGL (version 4.5 minimum), Vulkan, or Metal (via MoltenVK) APIs through a custom build of OpenTK or Silk.NET respectively. There are currently six graphics enhancements available to the end user in Ryujinx: Disk Shader Caching, Resolution Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, Scaling Filters (including FSR), Anisotropic Filtering and Aspect Ratio Adjustment. These enhancements can be adjusted or toggled as desired in the GUI. - **Input** We currently have support for keyboard, mouse, touch input, JoyCon input support, and nearly all controllers. Motion controls are natively supported in most cases; for dual-JoyCon motion support, DS4Windows or BetterJoy are currently required. In all scenarios, you can set up everything inside the input configuration menu. - **DLC & Modifications** Ryujinx is able to manage add-on content/downloadable content through the GUI. Mods (romfs, exefs, and runtime mods such as cheats) are also supported; the GUI contains a shortcut to open the respective mods folder for a particular game. - **Configuration** The emulator has settings for enabling or disabling some logging, remapping controllers, and more. You can configure all of them through the graphical interface or manually through the config file, `Config.json`, found in the user folder which can be accessed by clicking `Open Ryujinx Folder` under the File menu in the GUI. ## Contact If you have contributions, suggestions, need emulator support or just want to get in touch with the team, join our [Discord server]( You may also review our [FAQ]( ## Donations If you'd like to support the project financially, Ryujinx has an active Patreon campaign. All developers working on the project do so in their free time, but the project has several expenses: * Hackable Nintendo Switch consoles to reverse-engineer the hardware * Additional computer hardware for testing purposes (e.g. GPUs to diagnose graphical bugs, etc.) * Licenses for various software development tools (e.g. Jetbrains, IDA) * Web hosting and infrastructure maintenance (e.g. LDN servers) All funds received through Patreon are considered a donation to support the project. Patrons receive early access to progress reports and exclusive access to developer interviews. ## License This software is licensed under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).

This is a drop-in replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper, providing additional useful features and improvements. This does not touch or modify the game client itself, it's just a launcher! So don't worry, there's no risk of being banned for using this. Running into a problem or need help with something? [Check out the Wiki]( If you can't find anything, or would like to suggest something, please [submit an issue]( or report it in our [Discord server]( Bloxstrap is only supported for PCs running Windows. ## Installing Download the [latest release of Bloxstrap]( and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it! Alternatively, you can install Bloxstrap via [Winget]( by running this in a Command Prompt window: ``` > winget install bloxstrap ``` You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime]( If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap after you've installed this. It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Bloxstrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on ""More info"" and then ""Run anyway"". Once installed, Bloxstrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed. ## Features Here's some of the features that Bloxstrap provides over the stock Roblox bootstrapper: * Persistent file modifications, includes re-adding the old death sound! * Painless and seamless support for Discord Rich Presence - no auth cookie needed! * A customizable launcher look * Lets you see what region your current server is located in * Lets you have multiple Roblox game instances open simultaneously All the available features are browsable through the Bloxstrap menu. Bloxstrap also only runs whenever necessary, so it doesn't stay running in the background when you're not playing. ## Screenshots ## Special thanks * [@MaximumADHD]( - Initially inspiring the idea for Bloxstrap with [Roblox Studio Mod Manager]( * [Multako]( - Designing the Bloxstrap logo. * [@1011025m]( - Providing a method for disabling the Roblox desktop app. * taskmanager ([@Mantaraix]( - Helping with designing the new menu look and layout. * [@Extravi]( - Allowing their presets to be bundled with Bloxstrap, and helping with improving UX. * [@axstin]( - Making [rbxfpsunlocker]( which was used for Bloxstrap's FPS unlocking up until v2.2.0.","181, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, enhancement, bug, clarification needed, not bloxstrap problem, needs investigation, information, http issue, question, pending release, critical, wontfix, submodules, open discussion, likely hyperion/x64, invalid, help wanted, good first issue, github_actions, duplicate, documentation, dependencies, .NET"

MemoryPack,Cysharp/MemoryPack,2881,"['C#', 'TypeScript', 'HTML']",[],"# MemoryPack []( []( []( Zero encoding extreme performance binary serializer for C# and Unity. > Compared with [System.Text.Json]( [protobuf-net]( [MessagePack for C#]( [Orleans.Serialization]( Measured by .NET 7 / Ryzen 9 5950X machine. These serializers have `IBufferWriter` method, serialized using `ArrayBufferWriter` and reused to avoid measure buffer copy. For standard objects, MemoryPack is x10 faster and x2 ~ x5 faster than other binary serializers. For struct array, MemoryPack is even more powerful, with speeds up to x50 ~ x200 greater than other serializers. MemoryPack is my 4th serializer, previously I've created well known serializers, ~~[ZeroFormatter]( ~~[Utf8Json]( [MessagePack for C#]( The reason for MemoryPack's speed is due to its C#-specific, C#-optimized binary format and a well tuned implementation based on my past experience. It is also a completely new design utilizing .NET 7 and C# 11 and the Incremental Source Generator (.NET Standard 2.1 (.NET 5, 6) and there is also Unity support). Other serializers perform many encoding operations such as VarInt encoding, tag, string, etc. MemoryPack format uses a zero-encoding design that copies as much C# memory as possible. Zero-encoding is similar to FlatBuffers, but it doesn't need a special type, MemoryPack's serialization target is POCO. Other than performance, MemoryPack has these features. * Support modern I/O APIs (`IBufferWriter`, `ReadOnlySpan`, `ReadOnlySequence`) * Native AOT friendly Source Generator based code generation, no Dynamic CodeGen (IL.Emit) * Reflectionless non-generics APIs * Deserialize into existing instance * Polymorphism (Union) serialization * Limited version-tolerant (fast/default) and full version-tolerant support * Circular reference serialization * PipeWriter/Reader based streaming serialization * TypeScript code generation and ASP.NET Core Formatter * Unity (2021.3) IL2CPP Support via .NET Source Generator Installation --- This library is distributed via NuGet. For best performance, recommend to use `.NET 7`. Minimum requirement is `.NET Standard 2.1`. > PM> Install-Package [MemoryPack]( And also a code editor requires Roslyn 4.3.1 support, for example Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3, .NET SDK 6.0.401. For details, see the [Roslyn Version Support]( document. For Unity, the requirements and installation process are completely different. See the [Unity](#unity) section for details. Quick Start --- Define a struct or class to be serialized and annotate it with the `[MemoryPackable]` attribute and the `partial` keyword. ```csharp using MemoryPack; [MemoryPackable] public partial class Person { public int Age { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } ``` Serialization code is generated by the C# source generator feature which implements the `IMemoryPackable` interface. In Visual Studio you can check a generated code by using a shortcut `Ctrl+K, R` on the class name and select `*.MemoryPackFormatter.g.cs`. Call `MemoryPackSerializer.Serialize/Deserialize` to serialize/deserialize an object instance. ```csharp var v = new Person { Age = 40, Name = ""John"" }; var bin = MemoryPackSerializer.Serialize(v); var val = MemoryPackSerializer.Deserialize(bin); ``` `Serialize` method supports a return type of `byte[]` as well as it can serialize to `IBufferWriter` or `Stream`. `Deserialize` method supports `ReadOnlySpan`, `ReadOnlySequence` and `Stream`. And there are alse non-generics versions. Built-in supported types --- These types can be serialized by default: * .NET primitives (`byte`, `int`, `bool`, `char`, `double`, etc.) * Unmanaged types (Any `enum`, Any user-defined `struct` which doesn't contain reference types) * `string`, `decimal`, `Half`, `Int128`, `UInt128`, `Guid`, `Rune`, `BigInteger` * `TimeSpan`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `TimeOnly`, `DateOnly`, `TimeZoneInfo` * `Complex`, `Plane`, `Quaternion` `Matrix3x2`, `Matrix4x4`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4` * `Uri`, `Version`, `StringBuilder`, `Type`, `BitArray`, `CultureInfo` * `T[]`, `T[,]`, `T[,,]`, `T[,,,]`, `Memory<>`, `ReadOnlyMemory<>`, `ArraySegment<>`, `ReadOnlySequence<>` * `Nullable<>`, `Lazy<>`, `KeyValuePair<,>`, `Tuple<,...>`, `ValueTuple<,...>` * `List<>`, `LinkedList<>`, `Queue<>`, `Stack<>`, `HashSet<>`, `SortedSet<>`, `PriorityQueue<,>` * `Dictionary<,>`, `SortedList<,>`, `SortedDictionary<,>`, `ReadOnlyDictionary<,>` * `Collection<>`, `ReadOnlyCollection<>`, `ObservableCollection<>`, `ReadOnlyObservableCollection<>` * `IEnumerable<>`, `ICollection<>`, `IList<>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<>`, `IReadOnlyList<>`, `ISet<>` * `IDictionary<,>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<,>`, `ILookup<,>`, `IGrouping<,>`, * `ConcurrentBag<>`, `ConcurrentQueue<>`, `ConcurrentStack<>`, `ConcurrentDictionary<,>`, `BlockingCollection<>` * Immutable collections (`ImmutableList<>`, etc.) and interfaces (`IImmutableList<>`, etc.) Define `[MemoryPackable]` `class` / `struct` / `record` / `record struct` --- `[MemoryPackable]` can annotate to any `class`, `struct`, `record`, `record struct` and `interface`. If a type is `struct` or `record struct` which contains no reference types ([C# Unmanaged types]( any additional annotation (ignore, include, constructor, callbacks) is not used, that serialize/deserialize directly from the memory. Otherwise, by default, `[MemoryPackable]` serializes public instance properties or fields. You can use `[MemoryPackIgnore]` to remove serialization target, `[MemoryPackInclude]` promotes a private member to serialization target. ```csharp [MemoryPackable] public partial class Sample { // these types are serialized by default public int PublicField; public readonly int PublicReadOnlyField; public int PublicProperty { get; set; } public int PrivateSetPublicProperty { get; private set; } public int ReadOnlyPublicProperty { get; } public int InitProperty { get; init; } public required int RequiredInitProperty { get; init; } // these types are not serialized by default int privateProperty { get; set; } int privateField; readonly int privateReadOnlyField; // use [MemoryPackIgnore] to remove target of a public member [MemoryPackIgnore] public int PublicProperty2 => PublicProperty + PublicField; // use [MemoryPackInclude] to promote a private member to serialization target [MemoryPackInclude] int privateField2; [MemoryPackInclude] int privateProperty2 { get; set; } } ``` `MemoryPack`'s code generator adds information about what members are serialized to the `` section. This can be viewed by hovering over the type with Intellisense. All members must be memorypack-serializable, if not the code generator will emit an error. MemoryPack has 35 diagnostics rules (`MEMPACK001` to `MEMPACK035`) to be defined comfortably. If target type is defined MemoryPack serialization externally and registered, use `[MemoryPackAllowSerialize]` to silent diagnostics. ```csharp [MemoryPackable] public partial class Sample2 { [MemoryPackAllowSerialize] public NotSerializableType? NotSerializableProperty { get; set; } } ``` Member order is **important**, MemoryPack does not serialize the member-name or other information, instead serializing fields in the order they are declared. If a type is inherited, serialization is performed in the order of parent child. The order of members can not change for the deserialization. For the schema evolution, see the [Version tolerant](#version-tolerant) section. The default order is sequential, but you can choose the explicit layout with `[MemoryPackable(SerializeLayout.Explicit)]` and `[MemoryPackOrder()]`. ```csharp // serialize Prop0 -> Prop1 [MemoryPackable(SerializeLayout.Explicit)] public partial class SampleExplicitOrder { [MemoryPackOrder(1)] public int Prop1 { get; set; } [MemoryPackOrder(0)] public int Prop0 { get; set; } } ``` ### Constructor selection MemoryPack supports both parameterized and parameterless constructors. The selection of the constructor follows these rules. (Applies to classes and structs). * If there is `[MemoryPackConstructor]`, use it. * If there is no explicit constructor (including private), use a parameterless one. * If there is one parameterless/parameterized constructor (including private), use it. * If there are multiple constructors, then the `[MemoryPackConstructor]` attribute must be applied to the desired constructor (the generator will not automatically choose one), otherwise the generator will emit an error. * If using a parameterized constructor, all parameter names must match corresponding member names (case-insensitive). ```csharp [MemoryPackable] public partial class Person { public readonly int Age; public readonly string Name; // You can use a parameterized constructor - parameter names must match corresponding members name (case-insensitive) public Person(int age, string name) { this.Age = age; this.Name = name; } } // also supports record primary constructor [MemoryPackable] public partial record Person2(int Age, string Name); public partial class Person3 { public int Age { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public Person3() { } // If there are multiple constructors, then [MemoryPackConstructor] should be used [MemoryPackConstructor] public Person3(int age, string name) { this.Age = age; this.Name = name; } } ``` ### Serialization callbacks When serializing/deserializing, MemoryPack can invoke a before/after event using the `[MemoryPackOnSerializing]`, `[MemoryPackOnSerialized]`, `[MemoryPackOnDeserializing]`, `[MemoryPackOnDeserialized]` attributes. It can annotate both static and instance (non-static) methods, and public and private methods. ```csharp [MemoryPackable] public partial class MethodCallSample { // method call order is static -> instance [MemoryPackOnSerializing] public static void OnSerializing1() { Console.WriteLine(nameof(OnSerializing1)); } // also allows private method [MemoryPackOnSerializing] void OnSerializing2() { Console.WriteLine(nameof(OnSerializing2)); } // serializing -> /* serialize */ -> serialized [MemoryPackOnSerialized] static void OnSerialized1() { Conso...

Event Sourcing ### 1.1 What is Event Sourcing? Event Sourcing is a design pattern in which results of business operations are stored as a series of events. It is an alternative way to persist data. In contrast with state-oriented persistence that only keeps the latest version of the entity state, Event Sourcing stores each state change as a separate event. Thanks to that, no business data is lost. Each operation results in the event stored in the database. That enables extended auditing and diagnostics capabilities (both technically and business-wise). What's more, as events contains the business context, it allows wide business analysis and reporting. In this repository I'm showing different aspects and patterns around Event Sourcing from the basic to advanced practices. Read more in my articles: - [How using events helps in a teams' autonomy]( - [When not to use Event Sourcing?]( ### 1.2 What is Event? Events represent facts in the past. They carry information about something accomplished. It should be named in the past tense, e.g. _""user added""_, _""order confirmed""_. Events are not directed to a specific recipient - they're broadcasted information. It's like telling a story at a party. We hope that someone listens to us, but we may quickly realise that no one is paying attention. Events: - are immutable: _""What has been seen, cannot be unseen""_. - can be ignored but cannot be retracted (as you cannot change the past). - can be interpreted differently. The basketball match result is a fact. Winning team fans will interpret it positively. Losing team fans - not so much. Read more in my articles: - [What's the difference between a command and an event?]( - [Events should be as small as possible, right?]( - [Anti-patterns in event modelling - Property Sourcing]( - [Anti-patterns in event modelling - State Obsession]( ### 1.3 What is Stream? Events are logically grouped into streams. In Event Sourcing, streams are the representation of the entities. All the entity state mutations end up as the persisted events. Entity state is retrieved by reading all the stream events and applying them one by one in the order of appearance. A stream should have a unique identifier representing the specific object. Each event has its own unique position within a stream. This position is usually represented by a numeric, incremental value. This number can be used to define the order of the events while retrieving the state. It can also be used to detect concurrency issues. ### 1.4 Event representation Technically events are messages. They may be represented, e.g. in JSON, Binary, XML format. Besides the data, they usually contain: - **id**: unique event identifier. - **type**: name of the event, e.g. _""invoice issued""_. - **stream id**: object id for which event was registered (e.g. invoice id). - **stream position** (also named _version_, _order of occurrence_, etc.): the number used to decide the order of the event's occurrence for the specific object (stream). - **timestamp**: representing a time at which the event happened. - other metadata like `correlation id`, `causation id`, etc. Sample event JSON can look like: ```json { ""id"": ""e44f813c-1a2f-4747-aed5-086805c6450e"", ""type"": ""invoice-issued"", ""streamId"": ""INV/2021/11/01"", ""streamPosition"": 1, ""timestamp"": ""2021-11-01T00:05:32.000Z"", ""data"": { ""issuedTo"": { ""name"": ""Oscar the Grouch"", ""address"": ""123 Sesame Street"" }, ""amount"": 34.12, ""number"": ""INV/2021/11/01"", ""issuedAt"": ""2021-11-01T00:05:32.000Z"" }, ""metadata"": { ""correlationId"": ""1fecc92e-3197-4191-b929-bd306e1110a4"", ""causationId"": ""c3cf07e8-9f2f-4c2d-a8e9-f8a612b4a7f1"" } } ``` Read more in my articles: - [Mapping event type by convention]( - [Explicit events serialisation in Event Sourcing]( ### 1.5 Event Storage Event Sourcing is not related to any type of storage implementation. As long as it fulfills the assumptions, it can be implemented having any backing database (relational, document, etc.). The state has to be represented by the append-only log of events. The events are stored in chronological order, and new events are appended to the previous event. Event Stores are the databases' category explicitly designed for such purpose. Read more in my articles: - [Let's build event store in one hour!]( - [What if I told you that Relational Databases are in fact Event Stores?]( ### 1.6 Retrieving the current state from events In Event Sourcing, the state is stored in events. Events are logically grouped into streams. Streams can be thought of as the entities' representation. Traditionally (e.g. in relational or document approach), each entity is stored as a separate record. | Id | IssuerName | IssuerAddress | Amount | Number | IssuedAt | | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------ | -------------- | ---------- | | e44f813c | Oscar the Grouch | 123 Sesame Street | 34.12 | INV/2021/11/01 | 2021-11-01 | In Event Sourcing, the entity is stored as the series of events that happened for this specific object, e.g. `InvoiceInitiated`, `InvoiceIssued`, `InvoiceSent`. ```json [ { ""id"": ""e44f813c-1a2f-4747-aed5-086805c6450e"", ""type"": ""invoice-initiated"", ""streamId"": ""INV/2021/11/01"", ""streamPosition"": 1, ""timestamp"": ""2021-11-01T00:05:32.000Z"", ""data"": { ""issuer"": { ""name"": ""Oscar the Grouch"", ""address"": ""123 Sesame Street"", }, ""amount"": 34.12, ""number"": ""INV/2021/11/01"", ""initiatedAt"": ""2021-11-01T00:05:32.000Z"" } }, { ""id"": ""5421d67d-d0fe-4c4c-b232-ff284810fb59"", ""type"": ""invoice-issued"", ""streamId"": ""INV/2021/11/01"", ""streamPosition"": 2, ""timestamp"": ""2021-11-01T00:11:32.000Z"", ""data...

dlss-swapper,beeradmoore/dlss-swapper,1514,"['C#', 'NSIS', 'Batchfile']",[],"# DLSS Swapper DLSS Swapper is a tool that allows you to conveniently download, manage, and swap DLSS dlls allowing you to upgrade or downgrade DLSS version in a game without the game needing an update. ## Why would you want to change the DLSS dlls in your game? See [this]( clip, or better yet just watch the entire video ([Lego Builder's Journey Ray Tracing Showcase + DLSS 2.2 Upgrades Analysis]( from Digital Foundry. DLSS 2.2 discussions start at 11:40. ## Please note This tool does **NOT** allow you to add DLSS to games that don't support it. This tool does **NOT** guarantee that swapping DLSS dlls will: - Improve DLSS performance. - Reduce DLSS artifacts. - Give a crash free experience. In many cases you may fix some issues, in other cases you may prevent a game from launching (until you restore your original dll, provided in the tool). Happy experimenting. As my university professor once said, > The good thing about computer [science] is we will never die wondering 'What if...?' Please, come and share your DLSS experience over in [r/DLSS_Swapper]( ## How do I get it? You can get the latest builds from our [GitHub releases]( page. ## It would be cool if DLSS Swapper could... Create a [feature request]( ## How can I contribute? More info on this soon. ## Minimum System Requirements Windows 10 64-bit (20H1, build 19041), While a nVidia GPU is not a requirement to run DLSS Swapper, it is a requirement to use DLSS.","57, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, feature request, bug, platform request, help wanted, good first issue, documentation, wontfix, question, invalid, duplicate"

Install missing fonts or specify a different fallback font through LoadOptions.DefaultGraphicEngine = new DefaultGraphicEngine(Fallback font name)`, see help page about [missing fonts]( - ClosedXML is not thread-safe. There is no guarantee that [parallel operations]( will work. The underlying OpenXML library is also not thread-safe. - If you get an exception `The type initializer for 'Gdip' threw an exception.` on Linux, you have to upgrade to 0.97+. ### Install ClosedXML via NuGet If you want to include ClosedXML in your project, you can [install it directly from NuGet]( To install ClosedXML, run the following command in the Package Manager Console ``` PM> Install-Package ClosedXML ``` ### What can you do with this?

That means that parameters can be omitted if they are provided via `.netconfig`, which is useful when reusing fixed settings across multiple projects in a solution, where the MSBuild task is only provided the dynamic values for the current project: Given the following `.netconfig`: ```gitconfig [ReportGenerator] reporttypes = Html;Latex targetdirectory = report historydirectory = history assemblyfilters = +Include;-Excluded verbosityLevel = Verbose ``` The above target could be simplified as: ```xml ``` ## Supported input and output file formats *ReportGenerator* supports several input and output formats.

Our class had these design goals: - **Intuitive syntax**. In languages such as Python, JSON feels like a first class data type. We used all the operator magic of modern C++ to achieve the same feeling in your code. Check out the [examples below](#examples) and you'll know what I mean. - **Trivial integration**. Our whole code consists of a single header file [`json.hpp`]( That's it. No library, no subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything should require no adjustment of your compiler flags or project settings. - **Serious testing**. Our code is heavily [unit-tested]( and covers [100%]( of the code, including all exceptional behavior. Furthermore, we checked with [Valgrind]( and the [Clang Sanitizers]( that there are no memory leaks. [Google OSS-Fuzz]( additionally runs fuzz tests against all parsers 24/7, effectively executing billions of tests so far. To maintain high quality, the project is following the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) best practices]( Other aspects were not so important to us: - **Memory efficiency**. Each JSON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one enumeration element (1 byte). The default generalization uses the following C++ data types: `std::string` for strings, `int64_t`, `uint64_t` or `double` for numbers, `std::map` for objects, `std::vector` for arrays, and `bool` for Booleans. However, you can template the generalized class `basic_json` to your needs. - **Speed**. There are certainly [faster JSON libraries]( out there. However, if your goal is to speed up your development by adding JSON support with a single header, then this library is the way to go. If you know how to use a `std::vector` or `std::map`, you are already set.

There is also a [**docset**]( for the documentation browsers [Dash]( [Velocity]( and [Zeal]( that contains the full [documentation]( as offline resource. ## Examples Here are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class. Beside the examples below, you may want to: Check the [documentation]( Browse the [standalone example files]( Every API function (documented in the [API Documentation]( has a corresponding standalone example file. For example, the [`emplace()`]( function has a matching [emplace.cpp]( example file. ### Read JSON from a file The `json` class provides an API for manipulating a JSON value. To create a `json` object by reading a JSON file: ```cpp #include #include using json = nlohmann::json; // ... std::ifstream f(""example.json""); json data = json::parse(f); ``` ### Creating `json` objects from JSON literals Assume you want to create hard-code this literal JSON value in a file, as a `json` object: ```json { ""pi"": 3.141, ""happy"": true } ``` There are various options: ```cpp // Using (raw) string literals and json::parse json ex1 = json::parse(R""( { ""pi"": 3.141, ""happy"": true } )""); // Using user-defined (raw) string literals using namespace nlohmann::literals; json ex2 = R""( { ""pi"": 3.141, ""happy"": true } )""_json; // Using initializer lists json ex3 = { {""happy"", true}, {""pi"", 3.141}, }; ``` ### JSON as first-class data type Here are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class. Assume you want to create the JSON object ```json { ""pi"": 3.141, ""happy"": true, ""name"": ""Niels"", ""nothing"": null, ""answer"": { ""everything"": 42 }, ""list"": [1, 0, 2], ""object"": { ""currency"": ""USD"", ""value"": 42.99 } } ``` With this library, you could write: ```cpp // create an empty structure (null) json j; // add a number that is stored as double (note the implicit conversion of j to an object) j[""pi""] = 3.141; // add a Boolean that is stored as bool j[""happy""] = true; // add a string that is stored as std::string j[""name""] = ""Niels""; // add another null object by passing nullptr j[""nothing""] = nullptr; // add an object inside the object j[""answer""][""everything""] = 42; // add an array that is stored as std::vector (using an initializer list) j[""list""] = { 1, 0, 2 }; // add another object (using an initializer list of pairs) j[""object""] = { {""currency"", ""USD""}, {""value"", 42.99} }; // instead, you could also write (which looks very similar to the JSON above) json j2 = { {""pi"", 3.141}, {""happy"", true}, {""name"", ""Niels""}, {""nothing"", nullptr}, {""answer"", { {""everything"", 42} }}, {""list"", {1, 0, 2}}, {""object"", { {""currency"", ""USD""}, {""value"", 42.99} }} }; ``` Note that in all these cases, you never need to ""tell"" the compiler which JSON value type you want to use. If you want to be explicit or express some edge cases, the functions [`json::array()`]( and [`json::object()`]( will help: ```cpp // a way to express the empty array [] json empty_array_explicit = json::array(); // ways to express the empty object {} json empty_object_implicit = json({}); json empty_object_explicit = json::object(); // a way to express an _array_ of key/value pairs [[""currency"", ""USD""], [""value"", 42.99]] json array_not_object = json::array({ {""currency"", ""USD""}, {""value"", 42.99} }); ``` ### Serialization / Deserialization #### To/from strings You can create a JSON value (deserialization) by appending `_json` to a string literal: ```cpp // create object from string literal json j = ""{ \""happy\"": true, \""pi\"": 3.141 }""_json; // or even nicer with a raw string literal auto j2 = R""( { ""happy"": true, ""pi"": 3.141 } )""_json; ``` Note that without appending the `_json` suffix, the passed string literal is not parsed, but just used as JSON string value. That is, `json j = ""{ \""happy\"": true, \""pi\"": 3.141 }""` would just store the string `""{ ""happy"": true, ""pi"": 3.141 }""` rather than parsing the actual object. The string literal should be brought into scope with `using namespace nlohmann::literals;` (see [`json::parse()`]( The above example can also be expressed explicitly using [`json::parse()`]( ```cpp // parse explicitly auto j3 = json::parse(R""({""happy"": true, ""pi"": 3.141})""); ``` You can also get a string representation of a JSON value (serialize): ```cpp // explicit conversion to string std::string s = j.dump(); // {""happy"":true,""pi"":3.141} // serialization with pretty printing // pass in the amount of spaces to indent std::cout << j.dump(4) << std::endl; // { // ""happy"": true, // ""pi"": 3.141 // } ``` Note the difference between serialization and assignment: ```cpp // store a string in a JSON value json j_string = ""this is a string""; // retrieve the string value auto cpp_string = j_string.template get(); // retrieve the string value (alternative when a variable already exists) std::string cpp_string2; j_string.get_to(cpp_string2); // retrieve the serialized value (explicit JSON serialization) std::string serialized_string = j_string.dump(); // output of original string std::cout << cpp_string << "" == "" << cpp_string2 << "" == "" << j_string.template get() << '\n'; // output of serialized value std::cout << j_string << "" == "" << serialized_string << std::endl; ``` [`.dump()`]( returns the originally stored string value. Note the library only supports UTF-8. When you store strings with different encodings in the library, calling [`dump()`]( may throw an exception unless `json::error_handler_t::replace` or `json::error_handler_t::ignore` are used as error handlers. #### To/from streams (e.g. files, string streams) You c...

ZeroTierOne,zerotier/ZeroTierOne,13573,"['C++', 'C', 'Assembly']","['decentralization', 'networking', 'peer-to-peer', 'sd-wan', 'sdn']","ZeroTier - Global Area Networking ====== *This document is written for a software developer audience. For information on using ZeroTier, see the: [Website]( [Documentation Site]( and [Discussion Forum]( ZeroTier is a smart programmable Ethernet switch for planet Earth. It allows all networked devices, VMs, containers, and applications to communicate as if they all reside in the same physical data center or cloud region. This is accomplished by combining a cryptographically addressed and secure peer to peer network (termed VL1) with an Ethernet emulation layer somewhat similar to VXLAN (termed VL2). Our VL2 Ethernet virtualization layer includes advanced enterprise SDN features like fine grained access control rules for network micro-segmentation and security monitoring. All ZeroTier traffic is encrypted end-to-end using secret keys that only you control. Most traffic flows peer to peer, though we offer free (but slow) relaying for users who cannot establish peer to peer connections. The goals and design principles of ZeroTier are inspired by among other things the original [Google BeyondCorp]( paper and the [Jericho Forum]( with its notion of ""deperimeterization."" Visit [ZeroTier's site]( for more information and [pre-built binary packages]( Apps for Android and iOS are available for free in the Google Play and Apple app stores. ZeroTier is licensed under the [BSL version 1.1]( See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) and the [ZeroTier pricing page]( for details. ZeroTier is free to use internally in businesses and academic institutions and for non-commercial purposes. Certain types of commercial use such as building closed-source apps and devices based on ZeroTier or offering ZeroTier network controllers and network management as a SaaS service require a commercial license. A small amount of third party code is also included in ZeroTier and is not subject to our BSL license. See [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) for a list of third party code, where it is included, and the licenses that apply to it. All of the third party code in ZeroTier is liberally licensed (MIT, BSD, Apache, public domain, etc.). ### Getting Started Everything in the ZeroTier world is controlled by two types of identifier: 40-bit/10-digit *ZeroTier addresses* and 64-bit/16-digit *network IDs*. These identifiers are easily distinguished by their length. A ZeroTier address identifies a node or ""device"" (laptop, phone, server, VM, app, etc.) while a network ID identifies a virtual Ethernet network that can be joined by devices. ZeroTier addresses can be thought of as port numbers on an enormous planet-wide enterprise Ethernet smart switch supporting VLANs. Network IDs are VLAN IDs to which these ports may be assigned. A single port can be assigned to more than one VLAN. A ZeroTier address looks like `8056c2e21c` and a network ID looks like `8056c2e21c000001`. Network IDs are composed of the ZeroTier address of that network's primary controller and an arbitrary 24-bit ID that identifies the network on this controller. Network controllers are roughly analogous to SDN controllers in SDN protocols like [OpenFlow]( though as with the analogy between VXLAN and VL2 this should not be read to imply that the protocols or design are the same. You can use our convenient and inexpensive SaaS hosted controllers at [my.zerotier.com]( or [run your own controller](controller/) if you don't mind messing around with JSON configuration files or writing scripts to do so. ### Project Layout The base path contains the ZeroTier One service main entry point (`one.cpp`), self test code, makefiles, etc. - `artwork/`: icons, logos, etc. - `attic/`: old stuff and experimental code that we want to keep around for reference. - `controller/`: the reference network controller implementation, which is built and included by default on desktop and server build targets. - `debian/`: files for building Debian packages on Linux. - `doc/`: manual pages and other documentation. - `ext/`: third party libraries, binaries that we ship for convenience on some platforms (Mac and Windows), and installation support files. - `include/`: include files for the ZeroTier core. - `java/`: a JNI wrapper used with our Android mobile app. (The whole Android app is not open source but may be made so in the future.) - `node/`: the ZeroTier virtual Ethernet switch core, which is designed to be entirely separate from the rest of the code and able to be built as a stand-alone OS-independent library. Note to developers: do not use C++11 features in here, since we want this to build on old embedded platforms that lack C++11 support. C++11 can be used elsewhere. - `osdep/`: code to support and integrate with OSes, including platform-specific stuff only built for certain targets. - `rule-compiler/`: JavaScript rules language compiler for defining network-level rules. - `service/`: the ZeroTier One service, which wraps the ZeroTier core and provides VPN-like connectivity to virtual networks for desktops, laptops, servers, VMs, and containers. - `windows/`: Visual Studio solution files, Windows service code, and the Windows task bar app UI. - `zeroidc/`: OIDC implementation used by ZeroTier service to log into SSO-enabled networks. (This part is written in Rust, and more Rust will be appearing in this repository in the future.) ### Contributing Please do pull requests off of the `dev` branch. Releases are done by merging `dev` into `main` and then tagging and doing builds. ### Build and Platform Notes To build on Mac and Linux just type `make`. On FreeBSD and OpenBSD `gmake` (GNU make) is required and can be installed from packages or ports. For Windows there is a Visual Studio solution in `windows/`. - **Mac** - Xcode command line tools for macOS 10.13 or newer are required. - Rust for x86_64 and ARM64 targets *if SSO is enabled in the build*. - **Linux** - The minimum compiler versions required are GCC/G++ 4.9.3 or CLANG/CLANG++ 3.4.2. (Install `clang` on CentOS 7 as G++ is too old.) - Linux makefiles automatically detect and prefer clang/clang++ if present as it produces smaller and slightly faster binaries in most cases. You can override by supplying CC and CXX variables on the make command line. - Rust for x86_64 and ARM64 targets *if SSO is enabled in the build*. - **Windows** - Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10 or newer. - Rust for x86_64 and ARM64 targets *if SSO is enabled in the build*. - **FreeBSD** - GNU make is required. Type `gmake` to build. - `binutils` is required. Type `pkg install binutils` to install. - Rust for x86_64 and ARM64 targets *if SSO is enabled in the build*. - **OpenBSD** - There is a limit of four network memberships on OpenBSD as there are only four tap devices (`/dev/tap0` through `/dev/tap3`). - GNU make is required. Type `gmake` to build. - Rust for x86_64 and ARM64 targets *if SSO is enabled in the build*. Typing `make selftest` will build a *zerotier-selftest* binary which unit tests various internals and reports on a few aspects of the build environment. It's a good idea to try this on novel platforms or architectures. ### Running Running *zerotier-one* with `-h` option will show help. On Linux and BSD, if you built from source, you can start the service with: sudo ./zerotier-one -d On most distributions, macOS, and Windows, the installer will start the service and set it up to start on boot. A home folder for your system will automatically be created. The service is controlled via the JSON API, which by default is available at `127.0.0.1:9993`. It also listens on `0.0.0.0:9993` which is only usable if `allowManagementFrom` is properly configured in `local.conf`. We include a *zerotier-cli* command line utility to make API calls for standard things like joining and leaving networks. The *authtoken.secret* file in the home folder contains the secret token for accessing this API. See [service/README.md](service/README.md) for API documentation. Here's where home folders live (by default) on each OS: * **Linux**: `/var/lib/zerotier-one` * **FreeBSD** / **OpenBSD**: `/var/db/zerotier-one` * **Mac**: `/Library/Application Support/ZeroTier/One` * **Windows**: `\ProgramData\ZeroTier\One` (That's the default. The base 'shared app data' folder might be different if Windows is installed with a non-standard drive letter assignment or layout.) ### Basic Troubleshooting For most users, it just works. If you are running a local system firewall, we recommend adding a rules permitting zerotier. If you installed binaries for Windows this should be done automatically. Other platforms might require manual editing of local firewall rules depending on your configuration. See the [documentation site]( for more information. The Mac firewall can be found under ""Security"" in System Preferences. Linux has a variety of firewall configuration systems and tools. On CentOS check `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` for IPTables rules. For other distributions consult your distribution's documentation. You'll also have to check the UIs or documentation for commercial third party firewall applications like Little Snitch (Mac), McAfee Firewall Enterprise (Windows), etc. if you are running any of those. Some corporate environments might have centrally managed firewall software, so you might also have to contact IT. ZeroTier One peers will automatically locate each other and communicate directly over a local wired LAN *if UDP port 9993 inbound is open*. If that port is filtered, they won't be able to see each others' LAN announcement packets. If you're experiencing poor performance between devices on the same physical network, check their firewall settings. Without LAN auto-location peers must attempt ""loopback"" NAT traversal, which sometimes fails and in any case requires that every packet traverse your external router twice. Users behind certain types of firewalls and ""symmetric"" NAT devices may not be able to connect to external peers directly at all. ZeroTier has limited support for port prediction and will *attempt* to traverse...

wabt,WebAssembly/wabt,6477,"['C++', 'C', 'Python']",['webassembly'],"[]( # WABT: The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit WABT (we pronounce it ""wabbit"") is a suite of tools for WebAssembly, including: - [**wat2wasm**]( translate from [WebAssembly text format]( to the [WebAssembly binary format]( - [**wasm2wat**]( the inverse of wat2wasm, translate from the binary format back to the text format (also known as a .wat) - [**wasm-objdump**]( print information about a wasm binary. Similiar to objdump. - [**wasm-interp**]( decode and run a WebAssembly binary file using a stack-based interpreter - [**wasm-decompile**]( decompile a wasm binary into readable C-like syntax. - [**wat-desugar**]( parse .wat text form as supported by the spec interpreter (s-expressions, flat syntax, or mixed) and print ""canonical"" flat format - [**wasm2c**]( convert a WebAssembly binary file to a C source and header - [**wasm-strip**]( remove sections of a WebAssembly binary file - [**wasm-validate**]( validate a file in the WebAssembly binary format - [**wast2json**]( convert a file in the wasm spec test format to a JSON file and associated wasm binary files - [**wasm-stats**]( output stats for a module - [**spectest-interp**]( read a Spectest JSON file, and run its tests in the interpreter These tools are intended for use in (or for development of) toolchains or other systems that want to manipulate WebAssembly files. Unlike the WebAssembly spec interpreter (which is written to be as simple, declarative and ""speccy"" as possible), they are written in C/C++ and designed for easier integration into other systems. Unlike [Binaryen]( these tools do not aim to provide an optimization platform or a higher-level compiler target; instead they aim for full fidelity and compliance with the spec (e.g. 1:1 round-trips with no changes to instructions). ## Online Demos Wabt has been compiled to JavaScript via emscripten. Some of the functionality is available in the following demos: - [index]( - [wat2wasm]( - [wasm2wat]( ## Supported Proposals * Proposal: Name and link to the WebAssembly proposal repo * flag: Flag to pass to the tool to enable/disable support for the feature * default: Whether the feature is enabled by default * binary: Whether wabt can read/write the binary format * text: Whether wabt can read/write the text format * validate: Whether wabt can validate the syntax * interpret: Whether wabt can execute these operations in `wasm-interp` or `spectest-interp` * wasm2c: Whether wasm2c supports these operations | Proposal | flag | default | binary | text | validate | interpret | wasm2c | | --------------------- | --------------------------- | - | - | - | - | - | - | | [exception handling][]| `--enable-exceptions` | | | | | | | | [mutable globals][] | `--disable-mutable-globals` | | | | | | | | [nontrapping float-to-int conversions][] | `--disable-saturating-float-to-int` | | | | | | | | [sign extension][] | `--disable-sign-extension` | | | | | | | | [simd][] | `--disable-simd` | | | | | | | | [threads][] | `--enable-threads` | | | | | | | | [multi-value][] | `--disable-multi-value` | | | | | | | | [tail-call][] | `--enable-tail-call` | | | | | | | | [bulk memory][] | `--disable-bulk-memory` | | | | | | | | [reference types][] | `--disable-reference-types` | | | | | | | | [annotations][] | `--enable-annotations` | | | | | | | | [memory64][] | `--enable-memory64` | | | | | | | | [multi-memory][] | `--enable-multi-memory` | | | | | | | | [extended-const][] | `--enable-extended-const` | | | | | | | | [relaxed-simd][] | `--enable-relaxed-simd` | | | | | | | [exception handling]: [mutable globals]: [nontrapping float-to-int conversions]: [sign extension]: [simd]: [threads]: [multi-value]: [tail-call]: [bulk memory]: [reference types]: [annotations]: [memory64]: [multi-memory]: [extended-const]: [relaxed-simd]: ## Cloning Clone as normal, but don't forget to get the submodules as well: ```console $ git clone --recursive $ cd wabt $ git submodule update --init ``` This will fetch the testsuite and gtest repos, which are needed for some tests. ## Building using CMake directly (Linux and macOS) You'll need [CMake]( You can then run CMake, the normal way: ```console $ mkdir build $ cd build $ cmake .. $ cmake --build . ``` This will produce build files using CMake's default build generator. Read the CMake documentation for more information. **NOTE**: You must create a separate directory for the build artifacts (e.g. `build` above). Running `cmake` from the repo root directory will not work since the build produces an executable called `wasm2c` which conflicts with the `wasm2c` directory. ## Building using the top-level `Makefile` (Linux and macOS) **NOTE**: Under the hood, this uses `make` to run CMake, which then calls `ninja` to perform that actual build. On some systems (typically macOS), this doesn't build properly. If you see these errors, you can build using CMake directly as described above. You'll need [CMake]( and [Ninja]( If you just run `make`, it will run CMake for you, and put the result in `out/clang/Debug/` by default: > Note: If you are on macOS, you will need to use CMake version 3.2 or higher ```console $ make ``` This will build the default version of the tools: a debug build using the Clang compiler. There are many make targets available for other configurations as well. They are generated from every combination of a compiler, build type and configuration. - compilers: `gcc`, `clang`, `gcc-i686`, `emscripten` - build types: `debug`, `release` - configurations: empty, `asan`, `msan`, `lsan`, `ubsan`, `fuzz`, `no-tests` They are combined with dashes, for example: ```console $ make clang-debug $ make gcc-i686-release $ make clang-debug-lsan $ make gcc-debug-no-tests ``` ## Building (Windows) You'll need [CMake]( You'll also need [Visual Studio]( (2015 or newer) or [MinGW]( _Note: Visual Studio 2017 and later come with CMake (and the Ninja build system) out of the box, and should be on your PATH if you open a Developer Command prompt. See for more details._ You can run CMake from the command prompt, or use the CMake GUI tool. See [Running CMake]( for more information. When running from the commandline, create a new directory for the build artifacts, then run cmake from this directory: ```console > cd [build dir] > cmake [wabt project root] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[config] -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[install directory] -G [generator] ``` The `[config]` parameter should be a CMake build type, typically `DEBUG` or `RELEASE`. The `[generator]` parameter should be the type of project you want to generate, for example `""Visual Studio 14 2015""`. You can see the list of available generators by running `cmake --help`. To build the project, you can use Visual Studio, or you can tell CMake to do it: ```console > cmake --build [wabt project root] --config [config] --target install ``` This will build and install to the installation directory you provided above. So, for example, if you want to build the debug configuration on Visual Studio 2015: ```console > mkdir build > cd build > cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..\ -G ""Visual Studio 14 2015"" > cmake --build . --config DEBUG --target install ``` ## Adding new keywords to the lexer If you want to add new keywords, you'll need to install [gperf]( Before you upload your PR, please run `make update-gperf` to update the prebuilt C++ sources in `src/prebuilt/`. ## Running wat2wasm Some examples: ```sh # parse test.wat and write to .wasm binary file with the same name $ bin/wat2wasm test.wat # parse test.wat and write to binary file test.wasm $ bin/wat2wasm test.wat -o test.wasm # parse spec-test.wast, and write verbose output to stdout (including the # meaning of every byte) $ bin/wat2wasm spec-test.wast -v ``` You can use `--help` to get additional help: ```console $ bin/wat2wasm --help ``` Or try the [online demo]( ## Running wasm2wat Some examples: ```sh # parse binary file test.wasm and write text file test.wat $ bin/wasm2wat test.wasm -o test.wat # parse test.wasm and write test.wat $ bin/wasm2wat test.wasm -o test.wat ``` You can use `--help` to get additional help: ```console $ bin/wasm2wat --help ``` Or try the [online demo]( ## Running wasm-interp Some examples: ```sh # parse binary file test.wasm, and type-check it $ bin/wasm-interp test.wasm # parse test.wasm and run all its exported functions $ bin/wasm-interp test.wasm --run-all-exports # parse test.wasm, run the exported functions and trace the output $ bin/wasm-interp test.wasm --run-all-exports --trace # parse test.json and run the spec tests $ bin/wasm-interp test.json --spec # parse test.wasm and run all its exported functions, setting the value stack # size to 100 elements $ bin/wasm-interp test.wasm -V 100 --run-all-exports ``` You can use `--help` to get additional help: ```console $ bin/wasm-interp --help ``` ## Running wast2json See [wast2json.md](docs/wast2json.md). ## Running wasm-decompile For example: ```sh # parse binary file test.wasm and write text file test.dcmp $ bin/wasm-decompile test.wasm -o test.dcmp ``` You can use `--help` to get additional help: ```console $ bin/wasm-decompile --help ``` See [decompiler.md](docs/decompiler.md) for more information on the language being generated. ## Running wasm2c See [wasm2c.md](wasm2c/README.md) ## Running the test suite See [test/README.md](test/README.md). ## Sanitizers To build with the [LLVM sanitizers]( append the sanitizer name to the target: ```console $ make clang-debug-asan $ make clang-debug-msan $ make clang-debug-lsan $ make clang-debug-ubsan ``` There are configurations for the Address Sanitizer (ASAN), Memory Sanitizer (MSAN), Leak Sanitizer (LSAN) and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSAN). You can read about the behaviors of the sanitizers in the link above, but essentially the Address Sanitizer finds invalid memory accesses (use after free, access out-of-bounds, etc.), Memory Sanitizer finds uses of uninitialized memory, the Leak Sanitizer finds memory leaks, and the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer finds undefined behavior (sur...

It allows you to directly access serialized data without parsing/unpacking it first, while still having great forwards/backwards compatibility. ## Quick Start 1. Build the compiler for flatbuffers (`flatc`) Use `cmake` to create the build files for your platform and then perform the compliation (Linux example). ``` cmake -G ""Unix Makefiles"" make -j ``` 2. Define your flatbuffer schema (`.fbs`) Write the [schema]( to define the data you want to serialize. See [monster.fbs]( for an example. 3. Generate code for your language(s) Use the `flatc` compiler to take your schema and generate language-specific code: ``` ./flatc --cpp --rust monster.fbs ``` Which generates `monster_generated.h` and `monster_generated.rs` files. 4. Serialize data Use the generated code, as well as the `FlatBufferBuilder` to construct your serialized buffer. ([`C++` example]( 5. Transmit/store/save Buffer Use your serialized buffer however you want. Send it to someone, save it for later, etc... 6. Read the data Use the generated accessors to read the data from the serialized buffer. It doesn't need to be the same language/schema version, FlatBuffers ensures the data is readable across languages and schema versions. See the [`Rust` example]( reading the data written by `C++`. ## Documentation **Go to our [landing page][] to browse our documentation.** ## Supported operating systems - Windows - macOS - Linux - Android - And any others with a recent C++ compiler (C++ 11 and newer) ## Supported programming languages Code generation and runtime libraries for many popular languages. 1.

async-profiler,async-profiler/async-profiler,7195,"['C++', 'Java', 'C']",[],"# async-profiler This project is a low overhead sampling profiler for Java that does not suffer from [Safepoint bias problem]( It features HotSpot-specific APIs to collect stack traces and to track memory allocations. The profiler works with OpenJDK and other Java runtimes based on the HotSpot JVM. async-profiler can trace the following kinds of events: - CPU cycles - Hardware and Software performance counters like cache misses, branch misses, page faults, context switches etc. - Allocations in Java Heap - Contented lock attempts, including both Java object monitors and ReentrantLocks See our [Wiki]( or [3 hours playlist]( to learn about all features. ## Download Current release (3.0): - Linux x64: [async-profiler-3.0-linux-x64.tar.gz]( - Linux arm64: [async-profiler-3.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz]( - macOS x64/arm64: [async-profiler-3.0-macos.zip]( - Converters between profile formats: [converter.jar]( (JFR to Flame Graph, JFR to pprof, collapsed stacks to Flame Graph) [Previous releases]( async-profiler also comes bundled with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2018.3 and later. For more information refer to [IntelliJ IDEA documentation]( ## Supported platforms | | Officially maintained builds | Other available ports | |-----------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------| | **Linux** | x64, arm64 | x86, arm32, ppc64le, riscv64, loongarch64 | | **macOS** | x64, arm64 | | ## CPU profiling In this mode profiler collects stack trace samples that include **Java** methods, **native** calls, **JVM** code and **kernel** functions. The general approach is receiving call stacks generated by `perf_events` and matching them up with call stacks generated by `AsyncGetCallTrace`, in order to produce an accurate profile of both Java and native code. Additionally, async-profiler provides a workaround to recover stack traces in some [corner cases]( where `AsyncGetCallTrace` fails. This approach has the following advantages compared to using `perf_events` directly with a Java agent that translates addresses to Java method names: * Does not require `-XX:+PreserveFramePointer`, which introduces performance overhead that can be sometimes as high as 10%. * Does not require generating a map file for translating Java code addresses to method names. * Displays interpreter frames. * Does not produce large intermediate files (perf.data) for further processing in user space scripts. If you wish to resolve frames within `libjvm`, the [debug symbols](#installing-debug-symbols) are required. ## ALLOCATION profiling The profiler can be configured to collect call sites where the largest amount of heap memory is allocated. async-profiler does not use intrusive techniques like bytecode instrumentation or expensive DTrace probes which have significant performance impact. It also does not affect Escape Analysis or prevent from JIT optimizations like allocation elimination. Only actual heap allocations are measured. The profiler features TLAB-driven sampling. It relies on HotSpot-specific callbacks to receive two kinds of notifications: - when an object is allocated in a newly created TLAB; - when an object is allocated on a slow path outside TLAB. Sampling interval can be adjusted with `--alloc` option. For example, `--alloc 500k` will take one sample after 500 KB of allocated space on average. Prior to JDK 11, intervals less than TLAB size will not take effect. ### Installing Debug Symbols Prior to JDK 11, the allocation profiler required HotSpot debug symbols. Some OpenJDK distributions (Amazon Corretto, Liberica JDK, Azul Zulu) already have them embedded in `libjvm.so`, other OpenJDK builds typically provide debug symbols in a separate package. For example, to install OpenJDK debug symbols on Debian / Ubuntu, run: ``` # apt install openjdk-17-dbg ``` (replace `17` with the desired version of JDK). On CentOS, RHEL and some other RPM-based distributions, this could be done with [debuginfo-install]( utility: ``` # debuginfo-install java-1.8.0-openjdk ``` On Gentoo the `icedtea` OpenJDK package can be built with the per-package setting `FEATURES=""nostrip""` to retain symbols. The `gdb` tool can be used to verify if debug symbols are properly installed for the `libjvm` library. For example, on Linux: ``` $ gdb $JAVA_HOME/lib/server/libjvm.so -ex 'info address UseG1GC' ``` This command's output will either contain `Symbol ""UseG1GC"" is at 0xxxxx` or `No symbol ""UseG1GC"" in current context`. ## Wall-clock profiling `-e wall` option tells async-profiler to sample all threads equally every given period of time regardless of thread status: Running, Sleeping or Blocked. For instance, this can be helpful when profiling application start-up time. Wall-clock profiler is most useful in per-thread mode: `-t`. Example: `asprof -e wall -t -i 5ms -f result.html 8983` ## Java method profiling `-e ClassName.methodName` option instruments the given Java method in order to record all invocations of this method with the stack traces. Example: `-e java.util.Properties.getProperty` will profile all places where `getProperty` method is called from. Only non-native Java methods are supported. To profile a native method, use hardware breakpoint event instead, e.g. `-e Java_java_lang_Throwable_fillInStackTrace` **Be aware** that if you attach async-profiler at runtime, the first instrumentation of a non-native Java method may cause the [deoptimization]( of all compiled methods. The subsequent instrumentation flushes only the _dependent code_. The massive CodeCache flush doesn't occur if attaching async-profiler as an agent. Here are some useful native methods that you may want to profile: * ```G1CollectedHeap::humongous_obj_allocate``` - trace _humongous allocations_ of the G1 GC, * ```JVM_StartThread``` - trace creation of new Java threads, * ```Java_java_lang_ClassLoader_defineClass1``` - trace class loading. ## Building Build status: []( Make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to your JDK installation, and then run `make`. GCC or Clang is required. After building, the profiler binaries will be in the `build` subdirectory. ## Basic Usage As of Linux 4.6, capturing kernel call stacks using `perf_events` from a non-root process requires setting two runtime variables. You can set them using sysctl or as follows: ``` # sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1 # sysctl kernel.kptr_restrict=0 ``` async-profiler works in the context of the target Java application, i.e. it runs as an agent in the process being profiled. `asprof` is a tool to attach and control the agent. A typical workflow would be to launch your Java application, attach the agent and start profiling, exercise your performance scenario, and then stop profiling. The agent's output, including the profiling results, will be displayed on the console where you've started `asprof`. Example: ``` $ jps 9234 Jps 8983 Computey $ asprof start 8983 $ asprof stop 8983 ``` The following may be used in lieu of the `pid` (8983): - The keyword `jps`, which will use the most recently launched Java process. - The application name as it appears in the `jps` output: e.g. `Computey` Alternatively, you may specify `-d` (duration) argument to profile the application for a fixed period of time with a single command. ``` $ asprof -d 30 8983 ``` By default, the profiling frequency is 100Hz (every 10ms of CPU time). Here is a sample of the output printed to the Java application's terminal: ``` --- Execution profile --- Total samples: 687 Unknown (native): 1 (0.15%) --- 6790000000 (98.84%) ns, 679 samples [ 0] Primes.isPrime [ 1] Primes.primesThread [ 2] Primes.access$000 [ 3] Primes$1.run [ 4] java.lang.Thread.run ... a lot of output omitted for brevity ... ns percent samples top ---------- ------- ------- --- 6790000000 98.84% 679 Primes.isPrime 40000000 0.58% 4 __do_softirq ... more output omitted ... ``` This indicates that the hottest method was `Primes.isPrime`, and the hottest call stack leading to it comes from `Primes.primesThread`. ## Launching as an Agent If you need to profile some code as soon as the JVM starts up, instead of using the `asprof`, it is possible to attach async-profiler as an agent on the command line. For example: ``` $ java -agentpath:/path/to/libasyncProfiler.so=start,event=cpu,file=profile.html ... ``` Agent library is configured through the JVMTI argument interface. The format of the arguments string is described [in the source code]( `asprof` actually converts command line arguments to that format. For instance, `-e wall` is converted to `event=wall`, `-f profile.html` is converted to `file=profile.html`, and so on. However, some arguments are processed directly by `asprof`. E.g. `-d 5` results in 3 actions: attaching profiler agent with start command, sleeping for 5 seconds, and then attaching the agent again with stop command. ## Multiple events It is possible to profile CPU, allocations, and locks at the same time. Instead of CPU, you may choose any other execution event: wall-clock, perf event, tracepoint, Java method, etc. The only output format that supports multiple events together is JFR. The recording will contain the following event types: - `jdk.ExecutionSample` - `jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB` (alloc) - `jdk.ObjectAllocationOutsideTLAB` (alloc) - `jdk.JavaMonitorEnter` (lock) - `jdk.ThreadPark` (lock) To start profiling cpu + allocations + locks together, specify ``` asprof -e cpu,alloc,lock -f profile.jfr ... ``` or use `--alloc` and `--lock` parameters with the desired threshold: ``` asprof -e cpu --alloc 2m --lock 10ms -f profile.jfr ... ``` The same, when starting profiler as an agent: ``` -agentpath:/path/to/libasyncProfiler.so=start,event=cpu,alloc=2m,lock=10ms,file=profile.jfr ``` ## Flame Graph visualization async-profiler provides out-of-the-box [Flame Graph]( support. Specify `-o flamegraph` argument to dump profiling results as an interactive HTML Flame Graph. Also, Flame Graph output format will be chosen automatically if the target filename ends with `.html`...

codon,exaloop/codon,13913,"['C++', 'Python', 'CMake']","['python', 'compiler', 'llvm', 'high-performance', 'gpu-programming']","Docs FAQ Blog Chat Roadmap Benchmarks ## What is Codon? Codon is a high-performance Python implementation that compiles to native machine code without any runtime overhead. Typical speedups over vanilla Python are on the order of 10-100x or more, on a single thread. Codon's performance is typically on par with (and sometimes better than) that of C/C++. Unlike Python, Codon supports native multithreading, which can lead to speedups many times higher still. *Think of Codon as Python reimagined for static, ahead-of-time compilation, built from the ground up with best possible performance in mind.* ### Goals - :bulb: **No learning curve:** Be as close to CPython as possible in terms of syntax, semantics and libraries - :rocket: **Top-notch performance:** At *least* on par with low-level languages like C, C++ or Rust - :computer: **Hardware support:** Full, seamless support for multicore programming, multithreading (no GIL!), GPU and more - :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Optimizations:** Comprehensive optimization framework that can target high-level Python constructs and libraries - :battery: **Interoperability:** Full interoperability with Python's ecosystem of packages and libraries ### Non-goals - :x: *Drop-in replacement for CPython:* Codon is not a drop-in replacement for CPython. There are some aspects of Python that are not suitable for static compilation we don't support these in Codon. There are ways to use Codon in larger Python codebases via its [JIT decorator]( or [Python extension backend]( Codon also supports calling any Python module via its [Python interoperability]( See also [*""Differences with Python""*]( in the docs. - :x: *New syntax and language constructs:* We try to avoid adding new syntax, keywords or other language features as much as possible. While Codon does add some new syntax in a couple places (e.g. to express parallelism), we try to make it as familiar and intuitive as possible. ## Install Pre-built binaries for Linux (x86_64) and macOS (x86_64 and arm64) are available alongside [each release]( Download and install with: ```bash /bin/bash -c ""$(curl -fsSL ``` Or you can [build from source]( ## Examples Codon is a Python-compatible language, and many Python programs will work with few if any modifications: ```python def fib(n): a, b = 0, 1 while a < n: print(a, end=' ') a, b = b, a+b print() fib(1000) ``` The `codon` compiler has a number of options and modes: ```bash # compile and run the program codon run fib.py # 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 # compile and run the program with optimizations enabled codon run -release fib.py # 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 # compile to executable with optimizations enabled codon build -release -exe fib.py ./fib # 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 # compile to LLVM IR file with optimizations enabled codon build -release -llvm fib.py # outputs file fib.ll ``` See [the docs]( for more options and examples. You can import and use any Python package from Codon. For example: ```python from python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt data = [x**2 for x in range(10)] plt.plot(data) plt.show() ``` (Just remember to set the `CODON_PYTHON` environment variable to the CPython shared library, as explained in the [the docs]( This prime counting example showcases Codon's [OpenMP]( support, enabled with the addition of one line. The `@par` annotation tells the compiler to parallelize the following `for`-loop, in this case using a dynamic schedule, chunk size of 100, and 16 threads. ```python from sys import argv def is_prime(n): factors = 0 for i in range(2, n): if n % i == 0: factors += 1 return factors == 0 limit = int(argv[1]) total = 0 @par(schedule='dynamic', chunk_size=100, num_threads=16) for i in range(2, limit): if is_prime(i): total += 1 print(total) ``` Codon supports writing and executing GPU kernels. Here's an example that computes the [Mandelbrot set]( ```python import gpu MAX = 1000 # maximum Mandelbrot iterations N = 4096 # width and height of image pixels = [0 for _ in range(N * N)] def scale(x, a, b): return a + (x/N)*(b - a) @gpu.kernel def mandelbrot(pixels): idx = (gpu.block.x * gpu.block.dim.x) + gpu.thread.x i, j = divmod(idx, N) c = complex(scale(j, -2.00, 0.47), scale(i, -1.12, 1.12)) z = 0j iteration = 0 while abs(z) <= 2 and iteration < MAX: z = z**2 + c iteration += 1 pixels[idx] = int(255 * iteration/MAX) mandelbrot(pixels, grid=(N*N)//1024, block=1024) ``` GPU programming can also be done using the `@par` syntax with `@par(gpu=True)`. ## Documentation Please see [docs.exaloop.io]( for in-depth documentation.","495, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Security, Insights, enhancement, bug, stdlib, question, help wanted, documentation, cla-signed, typecheck, installation, dependencies, wontfix, invalid, good first issue, duplicate"

LIO-SAM,TixiaoShan/LIO-SAM,3124,"['C++', 'Python', 'CMake']","['lidar-odometry', 'lidar-slam', 'loam-velodyne', 'lidar-inertial', '3d-mapping']","# LIO-SAM **A real-time lidar-inertial odometry package. We strongly recommend the users read this document thoroughly and test the package with the provided dataset first. A video of the demonstration of the method can be found on [YouTube]( ## Menu - [**System architecture**](#system-architecture) - [**Package dependency**](#dependency) - [**Package install**](#install) - [**Prepare lidar data**](#prepare-lidar-data) (must read) - [**Prepare IMU data**](#prepare-imu-data) (must read) - [**Sample datasets**](#sample-datasets) - [**Run the package**](#run-the-package) - [**Other notes**](#other-notes) - [**Issues**](#issues) - [**Paper**](#paper) - [**TODO**](#todo) - [**Related Package**](#related-package) - [**Acknowledgement**](#acknowledgement) ## System architecture We design a system that maintains two graphs and runs up to 10x faster than real-time. - The factor graph in ""mapOptimization.cpp"" optimizes lidar odometry factor and GPS factor. This factor graph is maintained consistently throughout the whole test. - The factor graph in ""imuPreintegration.cpp"" optimizes IMU and lidar odometry factor and estimates IMU bias. This factor graph is reset periodically and guarantees real-time odometry estimation at IMU frequency. ## Dependency This is the original ROS1 implementation of LIO-SAM. For a ROS2 implementation see branch `ros2`. - [ROS]( (tested with Kinetic and Melodic. Refer to [#206]( for Noetic) ``` sudo apt-get install -y ros-kinetic-navigation sudo apt-get install -y ros-kinetic-robot-localization sudo apt-get install -y ros-kinetic-robot-state-publisher ``` - [gtsam]( (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping library) ``` sudo add-apt-repository ppa:borglab/gtsam-release-4.0 sudo apt install libgtsam-dev libgtsam-unstable-dev ``` ## Install Use the following commands to download and compile the package. ``` cd ~/catkin_ws/src git clone cd .. catkin_make ``` ## Using Docker Build image (based on ROS1 Kinetic): ```bash docker build -t liosam-kinetic-xenial . ``` Once you have the image, start a container as follows: ```bash docker run --init -it -d \ -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \ -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \ -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \ -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \ liosam-kinetic-xenial \ bash ``` ## Prepare lidar data The user needs to prepare the point cloud data in the correct format for cloud deskewing, which is mainly done in ""imageProjection.cpp"". The two requirements are: - **Provide point time stamp**. LIO-SAM uses IMU data to perform point cloud deskew. Thus, the relative point time in a scan needs to be known. The up-to-date Velodyne ROS driver should output this information directly. Here, we assume the point time channel is called ""time."" The definition of the point type is located at the top of the ""imageProjection.cpp."" ""deskewPoint()"" function utilizes this relative time to obtain the transformation of this point relative to the beginning of the scan. When the lidar rotates at 10Hz, the timestamp of a point should vary between 0 and 0.1 seconds. If you are using other lidar sensors, you may need to change the name of this time channel and make sure that it is the relative time in a scan. - **Provide point ring number**. LIO-SAM uses this information to organize the point correctly in a matrix. The ring number indicates which channel of the sensor that this point belongs to. The definition of the point type is located at the top of ""imageProjection.cpp."" The up-to-date Velodyne ROS driver should output this information directly. Again, if you are using other lidar sensors, you may need to rename this information. Note that only mechanical lidars are supported by the package currently. ## Prepare IMU data - **IMU requirement**. Like the original LOAM implementation, LIO-SAM only works with a 9-axis IMU, which gives roll, pitch, and yaw estimation. The roll and pitch estimation is mainly used to initialize the system at the correct attitude. The yaw estimation initializes the system at the right heading when using GPS data. Theoretically, an initialization procedure like VINS-Mono will enable LIO-SAM to work with a 6-axis IMU. (**New**: [liorf]( has added support for 6-axis IMU.) The performance of the system largely depends on the quality of the IMU measurements. The higher the IMU data rate, the better the system accuracy. We use Microstrain 3DM-GX5-25, which outputs data at 500Hz. We recommend using an IMU that gives at least a 200Hz output rate. Note that the internal IMU of Ouster lidar is an 6-axis IMU. - **IMU alignment**. LIO-SAM transforms IMU raw data from the IMU frame to the Lidar frame, which follows the ROS REP-105 convention (x - forward, y - left, z - upward). To make the system function properly, the correct extrinsic transformation needs to be provided in ""params.yaml"" file. **The reason why there are two extrinsics is that my IMU (Microstrain 3DM-GX5-25) acceleration and attitude have different cooridinates. Depend on your IMU manufacturer, the two extrinsics for your IMU may or may not be the same**. Using our setup as an example: - we need to set the readings of x-z acceleration and gyro negative to transform the IMU data in the lidar frame, which is indicated by ""extrinsicRot"" in ""params.yaml."" - The transformation of attitude readings might be slightly different. IMU's attitude measurement `q_wb` usually means the rotation of points in the IMU coordinate system to the world coordinate system (e.g. ENU). However, the algorithm requires `q_wl`, the rotation from lidar to world. So we need a rotation from lidar to IMU `q_bl`, where `q_wl = q_wb * q_bl`. For convenience, the user only needs to provide `q_lb` as ""extrinsicRPY"" in ""params.yaml"" (same as the ""extrinsicRot"" if acceleration and attitude have the same coordinate). - **IMU debug**. It's strongly recommended that the user uncomment the debug lines in ""imuHandler()"" of ""imageProjection.cpp"" and test the output of the transformed IMU data. The user can rotate the sensor suite to check whether the readings correspond to the sensor's movement. A YouTube video that shows the corrected IMU data can be found [here (link to YouTube)]( ## Sample datasets * Download some sample datasets to test the functionality of the package. The datasets below are configured to run using the default settings: - **Walking dataset:** [[Google Drive]( - **Park dataset:** [[Google Drive]( - **Garden dataset:** [[Google Drive]( * The datasets below need the parameters to be configured. In these datasets, the point cloud topic is ""points_raw."" The IMU topic is ""imu_correct,"" which gives the IMU data in ROS REP105 standard. Because no IMU transformation is needed for this dataset, the following configurations need to be changed to run this dataset successfully: - The ""imuTopic"" parameter in ""config/params.yaml"" needs to be set to ""imu_correct"". - The ""extrinsicRot"" and ""extrinsicRPY"" in ""config/params.yaml"" needs to be set as identity matrices. - **Rotation dataset:** [[Google Drive]( - **Campus dataset (large):** [[Google Drive]( - **Campus dataset (small):** [[Google Drive]( * Ouster (OS1-128) dataset. No extrinsics need to be changed for this dataset if you are using the default settings. Please follow the Ouster notes below to configure the package to run with Ouster data. A video of the dataset can be found on [YouTube]( - **Rooftop dataset:** [[Google Drive]( * Livox Horizon dataset. Please refer to the following notes section for paramater changes. - **Livox Horizon:** [[Google Drive]( * KITTI dataset. The extrinsics can be found in the Notes KITTI section below. To generate more bags using other KITTI raw data, you can use the python script provided in ""config/doc/kitti2bag"". - **2011_09_30_drive_0028:** [[Google Drive]( ## Run the package 1. Run the launch file: ``` roslaunch lio_sam run.launch ``` 2. Play existing bag files: ``` rosbag play your-bag.bag -r 3 ``` ## Other notes - **Loop closure:** The loop function here gives an example of proof of concept. It is directly adapted from LeGO-LOAM loop closure. For more advanced loop closure implementation, please refer to [ScanContext]( Set the ""loopClosureEnableFlag"" in ""params.yaml"" to ""true"" to test the loop closure function. In Rviz, uncheck ""Map (cloud)"" and check ""Map (global)"". This is because the visualized map - ""Map (cloud)"" - is simply a stack of point clouds in Rviz. Their postion will not be updated after pose correction. The loop closure function here is simply adapted from LeGO-LOAM, which is an ICP-based method. Because ICP runs pretty slow, it is suggested that the playback speed is set to be ""-r 1"". You can try the Garden dataset for testing. - **Using GPS:** The park dataset is provided for testing LIO-SAM with GPS data. This dataset is gathered by [Yewei Huang]( To enable the GPS function, change ""gpsTopic"" in ""params.yaml"" to ""odometry/gps"". In Rviz, uncheck ""Map (cloud)"" and check ""Map (global)"". Also check ""Odom GPS"", which visualizes the GPS odometry. ""gpsCovThreshold"" can be adjusted to filter bad GPS readings. ""poseCovThreshold"" can be used to adjust the frequency of adding GPS factor to the graph. For example, you will notice the trajectory is constantly corrected by GPS whey you set ""poseCovThreshold"" to 1.0. Because of the heavy iSAM optimization, it's recommended that the playback speed is ""-r 1"". - **KITTI:** Since LIO-SAM needs a high-frequency IMU for function properly, we need to use KITTI raw data for testing. One problem remains unsolved is that the intrinsics of the IMU are unknown, which has a big impact on the accuracy of LIO-SAM. Download the provided sample data and make the following changes in ""params.yaml"": - extrinsicTrans: [-8.086759e-01, 3.195559e-01, -7.997231e-01] - extrinsicRot: [9.999976e-01, 7.553071e-04, -2.035826e-03, -7.854027e-04, 9.998898e-01, -1.482298e-02, 2.024406e-03, 1.482454e-02, 9.998881e-01] - extrinsicRPY: [9.999976e-01, 7.553071e-04, -2.035826e-03, -7.854027e-04, 9.998898e-01, -1.482298e-02, 2.024406e-03, 1....

lyra,google/lyra,3773,"['C++', 'Starlark', 'Java']",[],"# Lyra: a generative low bitrate speech codec ## What is Lyra? [Lyra]( is a high-quality, low-bitrate speech codec that makes voice communication available even on the slowest networks. To do this it applies traditional codec techniques while leveraging advances in machine learning (ML) with models trained on thousands of hours of data to create a novel method for compressing and transmitting voice signals. ### Overview The basic architecture of the Lyra codec is quite simple. Features are extracted from speech every 20ms and are then compressed for transmission at a desired bitrate between 3.2kbps and 9.2kbps. On the other end, a generative model uses those features to recreate the speech signal. Lyra harnesses the power of new natural-sounding generative models to maintain the low bitrate of parametric codecs while achieving high quality, on par with state-of-the-art waveform codecs used in most streaming and communication platforms today. Computational complexity is reduced by using a cheaper convolutional generative model called SoundStream, which enables Lyra to not only run on cloud servers, but also on-device on low-end phones in real time (with a processing latency of 20ms). This whole system is then trained end-to-end on thousands of hours of speech data with speakers in over 90 languages and optimized to accurately recreate the input audio. Lyra is supported on Android, Linux, Mac and Windows. ## Prerequisites There are a few things you'll need to do to set up your computer to build Lyra. ### Common setup Lyra is built using Google's build system, Bazel. Install it following these [instructions]( Bazel verson 5.0.0 is required, and some Linux distributions may make an older version available in their application repositories, so make sure you are using the required version or newer. The latest version can be downloaded via [Github]( You will also need python3 and numpy installed. Lyra can be built from Linux using Bazel for an ARM Android target, or a Linux target, as well as Mac and Windows for native targets. ### Android requirements Building on android requires downloading a specific version of the android NDK toolchain. If you develop with Android Studio already, you might not need to do these steps if ANDROID_HOME and ANDROID_NDK_HOME are defined and pointing at the right version of the NDK. 1. Download command line tools from 2. Unzip and cd to the directory 3. Check the available packages to install in case they don't match the following steps. ```shell bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=$HOME/android/sdk --list ``` Some systems will already have the java runtime set up. But if you see an error here like `ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found on your PATH.`, this means you need to install the java runtime with `sudo apt install default-jdk` first. You will also need to add `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` (type `ls /usr/lib/jvm` to see which path was installed) to your $HOME/.bashrc and reload it with `source $HOME/.bashrc`. 4. Install the r21 ndk, android sdk 30, and build tools: ```shell bin/sdkmanager --sdk_root=$HOME/android/sdk --install ""platforms;android-30"" ""build-tools;30.0.3"" ""ndk;21.4.7075529"" ``` 5. Add the following to .bashrc (or export the variables) ```shell export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=$HOME/android/sdk/ndk/21.4.7075529 export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/android/sdk ``` 6. Reload .bashrc (with `source $HOME/.bashrc`) ## Building The building and running process differs slightly depending on the selected platform. ### Building for Linux You can build the cc_binaries with the default config. `encoder_main` is an example of a file encoder. ```shell bazel build -c opt lyra/cli_example:encoder_main ``` You can run `encoder_main` to encode a test .wav file with some speech in it, specified by `--input_path`. The `--output_dir` specifies where to write the encoded (compressed) representation, and the desired bitrate can be specified using the `--bitrate` flag. ```shell bazel-bin/lyra/cli_example/encoder_main --input_path=lyra/testdata/sample1_16kHz.wav --output_dir=$HOME/temp --bitrate=3200 ``` Similarly, you can build decoder_main and use it on the output of encoder_main to decode the encoded data back into speech. ```shell bazel build -c opt lyra/cli_example:decoder_main bazel-bin/lyra/cli_example/decoder_main --encoded_path=$HOME/temp/sample1_16kHz.lyra --output_dir=$HOME/temp/ --bitrate=3200 ``` Note: the default Bazel toolchain is automatically configured and likely uses gcc/libstdc++ on Linux. This should be satisfactory for most users, but will differ from the NDK toolchain, which uses clang/libc++. To use a custom clang toolchain on Linux, see toolchain/README.md and .bazelrc. ### Building for Android #### Android App There is an example APK target called `lyra_android_example` that you can build after you have set up the NDK. This example is an app with a minimal GUI that has buttons for two options. One option is to record from the microphone and encode/decode with Lyra so you can test what Lyra would sound like for your voice. The other option runs a benchmark that encodes and decodes in the background and prints the timings to logcat. ```shell bazel build -c opt lyra/android_example:lyra_android_example --config=android_arm64 --copt=-DBENCHMARK adb install bazel-bin/lyra/android_example/lyra_android_example.apk ``` After this you should see an app called ""Lyra Example App"". You can open it, and you will see a simple TextView that says the benchmark is running, and when it finishes. Press ""Record from microphone"", say a few words, and then press ""Encode and decode to speaker"". You should hear your voice being played back after being coded with Lyra. If you press 'Benchmark', you should see something like the following in logcat on a Pixel 6 Pro when running the benchmark: ```shell lyra_benchmark: feature_extractor: max: 1.836 ms min: 0.132 ms mean: 0.153 ms stdev: 0.042 ms lyra_benchmark: quantizer_quantize: max: 1.042 ms min: 0.120 ms mean: 0.130 ms stdev: 0.028 ms lyra_benchmark: quantizer_decode: max: 0.103 ms min: 0.026 ms mean: 0.029 ms stdev: 0.003 ms lyra_benchmark: model_decode: max: 0.820 ms min: 0.191 ms mean: 0.212 ms stdev: 0.031 ms lyra_benchmark: total: max: 2.536 ms min: 0.471 ms mean: 0.525 ms stdev: 0.088 ms ``` This shows that decoding a 50Hz frame (each frame is 20 milliseconds) takes 0.525 milliseconds on average. So decoding is performed at around 38 (20/0.525) times faster than realtime. To build your own android app, you can either use the cc_library target outputs to create a .so that you can use in your own build system. Or you can use it with an [`android_binary`]( rule within bazel to create an .apk file as in this example. There is a tutorial on building for android with Bazel in the [bazel docs]( #### Android command-line binaries There are also the binary targets that you can use to experiment with encoding and decoding .wav files. You can build the example cc_binary targets with: ```shell bazel build -c opt lyra/cli_example:encoder_main --config=android_arm64 bazel build -c opt lyra/cli_example:decoder_main --config=android_arm64 ``` This builds an executable binary that can be run on android 64-bit arm devices (not an android app). You can then push it to your android device and run it as a binary through the shell. ```shell # Push the binary and the data it needs, including the model and .wav files: adb push bazel-bin/lyra/cli_example/encoder_main /data/local/tmp/ adb push bazel-bin/lyra/cli_example/decoder_main /data/local/tmp/ adb push lyra/model_coeffs/ /data/local/tmp/ adb push lyra/testdata/ /data/local/tmp/ adb shell cd /data/local/tmp ./encoder_main --model_path=/data/local/tmp/model_coeffs --output_dir=/data/local/tmp --input_path=testdata/sample1_16kHz.wav ./decoder_main --model_path=/data/local/tmp/model_coeffs --output_dir=/data/local/tmp --encoded_path=sample1_16kHz.lyra ``` The encoder_main/decoder_main as above should also work. ### Building for Mac You will need to install the XCode command line tools in addition to the prerequisites common to all platforms. XCode setup is a required step for using Bazel on Mac. See this [guide]( for how to install XCode command line tools. Lyra has been built successfully using XCode 13.3. You can follow the instructions in the [Building for Linux](#building-for-linux) section once this is completed. ### Building for Windows You will need to install Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019 in addition to the prerequisites common to all platforms. Visual Studio setup is a required step for building C++ for Bazel on Windows. See this [guide]( for how to install MSVC. You may also need to install python 3 support, which is also described in the guide. You can follow the instructions in the [Building for Linux](#building-for-linux) section once this is completed. ## API For integrating Lyra into any project only two APIs are relevant: [LyraEncoder](lyra/lyra_encoder.h) and [LyraDecoder](lyra/lyra_decoder.h). > DISCLAIMER: At this time Lyra's API and bit-stream are **not** guaranteed to > be stable and might change in future versions of the code. On the sending side, `LyraEncoder` can be used to encode an audio stream using the following interface: ```cpp class LyraEncoder : public LyraEncoderInterface { public: static std::unique_ptr Create( int sample_rate_hz, int num_channels, int bitrate, bool enable_dtx, const ghc::filesystem::path& model_path); std::optional> Encode( const absl::Span audio) override; bool set_bitrate(int bitrate) override; int sample_rate_hz() const override; int num_channels() const override; int bitrate() const override; int frame_rate() const override; }; ``` The static `Create` method instantiates a `LyraEncoder` with the desired sample rate in Hertz, number of channels and bitrate, as long as those parameters are supported (see `lyra_encoder.h` for supported parameters). Otherwise it returns a nullptr. The `Create` method also needs to know if DTX s...

Marlin,MarlinFirmware/Marlin,15966,"['C++', 'C', 'Python']","['reprap', 'arduino', '3d-printing', 'firmware', 'avr']","Marlin 3D Printer Firmware Additional documentation can be found at the [Marlin Home Page]( Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by! ## Marlin 2.1 Bugfix Branch __Not for production use. Use with caution!__ Marlin 2.1 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a ""Hardware Abstraction Layer"" below. This branch is for patches to the latest 2.1.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.1.x release. Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page]( ## Example Configurations Before you can build Marlin for your machine you'll need a configuration for your specific hardware. Upon request, your vendor will be happy to provide you with the complete source code and configurations for your machine, but you'll need to get updated configuration files if you want to install a newer version of Marlin. Fortunately, Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations]( repository to find the right configuration for your hardware. ## Building Marlin 2.1 To build and upload Marlin you will use one of these tools: - The free [Visual Studio Code]( using the [Auto Build Marlin]( extension. - The free [Arduino IDE]( : See [Building Marlin with Arduino]( - You can also use VSCode with devcontainer : See [Installing Marlin (VSCode devcontainer)]( Marlin is optimized to build with the **PlatformIO IDE** extension for **Visual Studio Code**. You can still build Marlin with **Arduino IDE**, and we hope to improve the Arduino build experience, but at this time PlatformIO is the better choice. ## 8-Bit AVR Boards We intend to continue supporting 8-bit AVR boards in perpetuity, maintaining a single codebase that can apply to all machines. We want casual hobbyists and tinkerers and owners of older machines to benefit from the community's innovations just as much as those with fancier machines. Plus, those old AVR-based machines are often the best for your testing and feedback! ## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Marlin includes an abstraction layer to provide a common API for all the platforms it targets. This allows Marlin code to address the details of motion and user interface tasks at the lowest and highest levels with no system overhead, tying all events directly to the hardware clock. Every new HAL opens up a world of hardware. At this time we need HALs for RP2040 and the Duet3D family of boards. A HAL that wraps an RTOS is an interesting concept that could be explored. Did you know that Marlin includes a Simulator that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux?

However, there are certain prerequisites that need to be met, such as having Linux perf_event support for your processor in the Linux kernel version you are currently running. To successfully run the PCM tools, you need to set the `/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid` setting to -1 as root once: ``` echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid ``` and configure two specific environment variables when running the tools under a non-root user: ``` export PCM_NO_MSR=1 export PCM_KEEP_NMI_WATCHDOG=1 ``` For instance, you can execute the following commands to set the environment variables and run pcm: ``` export PCM_NO_MSR=1 export PCM_KEEP_NMI_WATCHDOG=1 pcm ``` or (to run the pcm sensor server as non-root): ``` PCM_NO_MSR=1 PCM_KEEP_NMI_WATCHDOG=1 pcm-sensor-server ``` Please keep in mind that when executing PCM tools under an unprivileged user on Linux, certain PCM metrics may be unavailable. This limitation specifically affects metrics that rely solely on direct MSR (Model-Specific Register) register access. Due to the restricted privileges of the user, accessing these registers is not permitted, resulting in the absence of corresponding metrics. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PCM's frequently asked questions (FAQ) are located [here](doc/FAQ.md). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PCM API documentation -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PCM API documentation is embedded in the source code and can be generated into html format from source using Doxygen (www.doxygen.org). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PCM environment variables -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The list of PCM environment variables is located [here](doc/ENVVAR_README.md) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Custom compilation options -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The list of custom compilation options is located [here](doc/CUSTOM-COMPILE-OPTIONS.md) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Packaging -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Packaging with CPack is supported on Debian and Redhat/SUSE system families. To create DEB of RPM package need to call cpack after building in build folder: ``` cd build cpack ``` This creates package: - ""pcm-VERSION-Linux.deb"" on Debian family systems; - ""pcm-VERSION-Linux.rpm"" on Redhat/SUSE-family systems.

[paper]( We propose a universal model for parsing visually-situated text across diverse scenarios, called OmniParser, which can simultaneously handle three typical visually-situated text parsing tasks: text spotting, key information extraction, and table recognition. In OmniParser, all tasks share the **unified encoder-decoder architecture**, the unified objective: **point-conditioned text generation**, and the unified input & output representation: **prompt & structured sequences**. **2024.3 Release** - [**GEM**](./DocumentUnderstanding/GEM/) (*GEM: Gestalt Enhanced Markup Language Model for Web Understanding via Render Tree,* EMNLP 2023. [paper]( Web pages serve as crucial carriers for humans to acquire and perceive information. Inspired by the Gestalt psychological theory, we propose an innovative Gestalt Enhanced Markup Language Model (GEM for short) for **hosting heterogeneous visual information from render trees of web pages**, leading to excellent performances on tasks such as web question answering and web information extraction. **2023.9 Release** - [**DocXChain**](./Applications/DocXChain/) (*DocXChain: A Powerful Open-Source Toolchain for Document Parsing and Beyond,* arXiv 2023.

Currently, basic capabilities, including text detection, text recognition, table structure recognition, and layout analysis, are provided. Also, typical pipelines, i.e., general text reading, table parsing, and document structurization, are built to support more complicated applications related to documents. Most of the algorithmic models are from [ModelScope]( Formula recognition (using models from [RapidLatexOCR]( and whole PDF conversion (PDF to JSON format) are now supported. - [**LISTER**](./OCR/LISTER/) (*LISTER: Neighbor Decoding for Length-Insensitive Scene Text Recognition,* ICCV 2023.

whisper,openai/whisper,61950,['Python'],[],"# Whisper [[Blog]]( [[Paper]]( [[Model card]]( [[Colab example]]( Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. ## Approach A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets. ## Setup We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch]( 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken]( for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command: pip install -U openai-whisper Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies: pip install git+ To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run: pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+ It also requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`]( to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers: ```bash # on Ubuntu or Debian sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg # on Arch Linux sudo pacman -S ffmpeg # on MacOS using Homebrew ( brew install ffmpeg # on Windows using Chocolatey ( choco install ffmpeg # on Windows using Scoop ( scoop install ffmpeg ``` You may need [`rust`]( installed as well, in case [tiktoken]( does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the `pip install` command above, please follow the [Getting started page]( to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the `PATH` environment variable, e.g. `export PATH=""$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH""`. If the installation fails with `No module named 'setuptools_rust'`, you need to install `setuptools_rust`, e.g. by running: ```bash pip install setuptools-rust ``` ## Available models and languages There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model; actual speed may vary depending on many factors including the available hardware. | Size | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed | |:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:| | tiny | 39 M | `tiny.en` | `tiny` | ~1 GB | ~32x | | base | 74 M | `base.en` | `base` | ~1 GB | ~16x | | small | 244 M | `small.en` | `small` | ~2 GB | ~6x | | medium | 769 M | `medium.en` | `medium` | ~5 GB | ~2x | | large | 1550 M | N/A | `large` | ~10 GB | 1x | The `.en` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the `tiny.en` and `base.en` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the `small.en` and `medium.en` models. Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of `large-v3` and `large-v2` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper]( as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3. ## Command-line usage The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the `medium` model: whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model medium The default setting (which selects the `small` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the `--language` option: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese Adding `--task translate` will translate the speech into English: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate Run the following to view all available options: whisper --help See [tokenizer.py]( for the list of all available languages. ## Python usage Transcription can also be performed within Python: ```python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(""base"") result = model.transcribe(""audio.mp3"") print(result[""text""]) ``` Internally, the `transcribe()` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window. Below is an example usage of `whisper.detect_language()` and `whisper.decode()` which provide lower-level access to the model. ```python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(""base"") # load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds audio = whisper.load_audio(""audio.mp3"") audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio) # make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device) # detect the spoken language _, probs = model.detect_language(mel) print(f""Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}"") # decode the audio options = whisper.DecodingOptions() result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options) # print the recognized text print(result.text) ``` ## More examples Please use the [ Show and tell]( category in Discussions for sharing more example usages of Whisper and third-party extensions such as web demos, integrations with other tools, ports for different platforms, etc. ## License Whisper's code and model weights are released under the MIT License.

Today's multi-object tracking options are heavily dependant on the computation capabilities of the underlaying hardware. BoxMOT provides a great variety of tracking methods that meet different hardware limitations, all the way from CPU only to larger GPUs. Morover, we provide scripts for ultra fast experimentation by saving detections and embeddings, which then be loaded into any tracking algorithm. Avoiding the overhead of repeatedly generating this data. ## Installation Start with [**Python>=3.8**]( environment. If you want to run the YOLOv8, YOLO-NAS or YOLOX examples: ``` git clone cd yolo_tracking pip install poetry poetry install --with yolo # installed boxmot + yolo dependencies poetry shell # activates the newly created environment with the installed dependencies ``` but if you only want to import the tracking modules you can simply: ``` pip install boxmot ``` ## YOLOv8 | YOLO-NAS | YOLOX examples Tracking Yolo models ```bash $ python tracking/track.py --yolo-model yolov8n # bboxes only python tracking/track.py --yolo-model yolo_nas_s # bboxes only python tracking/track.py --yolo-model yolox_n # bboxes only yolov8n-seg # bboxes + segmentation masks yolov8n-pose # bboxes + pose estimation ``` Tracking methods ```bash $ python tracking/track.py --tracking-method deepocsort strongsort ocsort bytetrack botsort ``` Tracking sources Tracking can be run on most video formats ```bash $ python tracking/track.py --source 0 # webcam img.jpg # image vid.mp4 # video path/ # directory path/*.jpg # glob ' # YouTube 'rtsp://example.com/media.mp4' # RTSP, RTMP, HTTP stream ``` Select ReID model Some tracking methods combine appearance description and motion in the process of tracking. For those which use appearance, you can choose a ReID model based on your needs from this [ReID model zoo]( These model can be further optimized for you needs by the [reid_export.py]( script ```bash $ python tracking/track.py --source 0 --reid-model lmbn_n_cuhk03_d.pt # lightweight osnet_x0_25_market1501.pt mobilenetv2_x1_4_msmt17.engine resnet50_msmt17.onnx osnet_x1_0_msmt17.pt clip_market1501.pt # heavy clip_vehicleid.pt ... ``` Filter tracked classes By default the tracker tracks all MS COCO classes. If you want to track a subset of the classes that you model predicts, add their corresponding index after the classes flag, ```bash python tracking/track.py --source 0 --yolo-model yolov8s.pt --classes 16 17 # COCO yolov8 model. Track cats and dogs, only ``` [Here]( is a list of all the possible objects that a Yolov8 model trained on MS COCO can detect. Notice that the indexing for the classes in this repo starts at zero Evaluation Evaluate a combination of detector, tracking method and ReID model on standard MOT dataset or you custom one by ```bash # saves dets and embs under ./runs/dets_n_embs separately for each selected yolo and reid model $ python tracking/generate_dets_n_embs.py --source ./assets/MOT17-mini/train --yolo-model yolov8n.pt yolov8s.pt --reid-model weights/osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt # generate MOT challenge format results based on pregenerated detections and embeddings for a specific trackign method $ python tracking/generate_mot_results.py --dets yolov8n --embs osnet_x0_25_msmt17 --tracking-method botsort # uses TrackEval to generate MOT metrics for the tracking results under ./runs/mot/ $ python tracking/val.py --benchmark MOT17-mini --dets yolov8n --embs osnet_x0_25_msmt17 --tracking-method botsort ``` Evolution We use a fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm for tracker hyperparameter tuning. By default the objectives are: HOTA, MOTA, IDF1. Run it by ```bash # saves dets and embs under ./runs/dets_n_embs separately for each selected yolo and reid model $ python tracking/generate_dets_n_embs.py --source ./assets/MOT17-mini/train --yolo-model yolov8n.pt yolov8s.pt --reid-model weights/osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt # evolve parameters for specified tracking method using the selected detections and embeddings generated in the previous step $ python tracking/evolve.py --benchmark MOT17-mini --dets yolov8n --embs osnet_x0_25_msmt17 --n-trials 9 --tracking-method botsort ``` The set of hyperparameters leading to the best HOTA result are written to the tracker's config file. ## Custom tracking examples Detection ```python import cv2 import numpy as np from pathlib import Path from boxmot import DeepOCSORT tracker = DeepOCSORT( model_weights=Path('osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt'), # which ReID model to use device='cuda:0', fp16=False, ) vid = cv2.VideoCapture(0) while True: ret, im = vid.read() # substitute by your object detector, output has to be N X (x, y, x, y, conf, cls) dets = np.array([[144, 212, 578, 480, 0.82, 0], [425, 281, 576, 472, 0.56, 65]]) tracker.update(dets, im) # --> M X (x, y, x, y, id, conf, cls, ind) tracker.plot_results(im, show_trajectories=True) # break on pressing q or space cv2.imshow('BoxMOT detection', im) key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF if key == ord(' ') or key == ord('q'): break vid.release() cv2.destroyAllWindows() ``` Pose & segmentation ```python import cv2 import numpy as np from pathlib import Path from boxmot import DeepOCSORT tracker = DeepOCSORT( model_weights=Path('osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt'), # which ReID model to use device='cuda:0', fp16=True, ) vid = cv2.VideoCapture(0) while True: ret, im = vid.read() keypoints = np.random.rand(2, 17, 3) mask = np.random.rand(2, 480, 640) # substitute by your object detector, input to tracker has to be N X (x, y, x, y, conf, cls) dets = np.array([[144, 212, 578, 480, 0.82, 0], [425, 281, 576, 472, 0.56, 65]]) tracks = tracker.update(dets, im) # --> M x (x, y, x, y, id, conf, cls, ind) # xyxys = tracks[:, 0:4].astype('int') # float64 to int # ids = tracks[:, 4].astype('int') # float64 to int # confs = tracks[:, 5] # clss = tracks[:, 6].astype('int') # float64 to int inds = tracks[:, 7].astype('int') # float64 to int # in case you have segmentations or poses alongside with your detections you can use # the ind variable in order to identify which track is associated to each seg or pose by: # masks = masks[inds] # keypoints = keypoints[inds] # such that you then can: zip(tracks, masks) or zip(tracks, keypoints) # break on pressing q or space cv2.imshow('BoxMOT segmentation | pose', im) key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF if key == ord(' ') or key == ord('q'): break vid.release() cv2.destroyAllWindows() ``` Tiled inference ```py from sahi import AutoDetectionModel from sahi.predict import get_sliced_prediction import cv2 import numpy as np from pathlib import Path from boxmot import DeepOCSORT tracker = DeepOCSORT( model_weights=Path('osnet_x0_25_msmt17.pt'), # which ReID model to use device='cpu', fp16=False, ) detection_model = AutoDetectionModel.from_pretrained( model_type='yolov8', model_path='yolov8n.pt', confidence_threshold=0.5, device=""cpu"", # or 'cuda...

This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds]( or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip's `--pre` flag). * The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds]( When using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel. `--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel. You may also use `--update-to ` (`/`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories. Example usage: * `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release * `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06` * `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel * `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24` **Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report: ``` # To update to nightly from stable executable/binary: yt-dlp --update-to nightly # To install nightly with pip: python3 -m pip install -U --pre ""yt-dlp[default]"" ``` ## DEPENDENCIES Python versions 3.8+ (CPython and PyPy) are supported.

Check out [LangChain.js]( To help you ship LangChain apps to production faster, check out [LangSmith]( [LangSmith]( is a unified developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications. Fill out [this form]( to speak with our sales team. ## Quick Install With pip: ```bash pip install langchain ``` With conda: ```bash conda install langchain -c conda-forge ``` ## What is LangChain? **LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). For these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle: - **Open-source libraries**: Build your applications using LangChain's [modular building blocks]( and [components]( Integrate with hundreds of [third-party providers]( - **Productionization**: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with [LangSmith]( so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence. - **Deployment**: Turn any chain into a REST API with [LangServe]( ### Open-source libraries - **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language. - **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations. - Some integrations have been further split into **partner packages** that only rely on **`langchain-core`**. Examples include **`langchain_openai`** and **`langchain_anthropic`**. - **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture. - **[`LangGraph`]( A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. ### Productionization: - **[LangSmith]( A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain. ### Deployment: - **[LangServe]( A library for deploying LangChain chains as REST APIs. ## What can you build with LangChain? ** Question answering with RAG** - [Documentation]( - End-to-end Example: [Chat LangChain]( and [repo]( ** Extracting structured output** - [Documentation]( - End-to-end Example: [SQL Llama2 Template]( ** Chatbots** - [Documentation]( - End-to-end Example: [Web LangChain (web researcher chatbot)]( and [repo]( And much more! Head to the [Use cases]( section of the docs for more. ## How does LangChain help? The main value props of the LangChain libraries are: 1. **Components**: composable building blocks, tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not 2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones. ## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LCEL is the foundation of many of LangChain's components, and is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains. - **[Overview]( LCEL and its benefits - **[Interface]( The standard interface for LCEL objects - **[Primitives]( More on the primitives LCEL includes ## Components Components fall into the following **modules**: ** Model I/O:** This includes [prompt management]( [prompt optimization]( a generic interface for [chat models]( and [LLMs]( and common utilities for working with [model outputs]( ** Retrieval:** Retrieval Augmented Generation involves [loading data]( from a variety of sources, [preparing it]( [then retrieving it]( for use in the generation step. ** Agents:** Agents allow an LLM autonomy over how a task is accomplished. Agents make decisions about which Actions to take, then take that Action, observe the result, and repeat until the task is complete done. LangChain provides a [standard interface for agents]( a [selection of agents]( to choose from, and examples of end-to-end agents. ## Documentation Please see [here]( for full documentation, which includes: - [Getting started]( installation, setting up the environment, simple examples - [Use case]( walkthroughs and best practice [guides]( - Overviews of the [interfaces]( [components]( and [integrations]( You can also check out the full [API Reference docs]( ## Ecosystem - [ LangSmith]( Tracing and evaluating your language model applications and intelligent agents to help you move from prototype to production. - [ LangGraph]( Creating stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of (and intended to be used with) LangChain primitives. - [ LangServe]( Deploying LangChain runnables and chains as REST APIs. - [LangChain Templates]( Example applications hosted with LangServe. ## Contributing As an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation.

airflow,apache/airflow,34818,"['Python', 'TypeScript', 'Shell']","['airflow', 'apache', 'apache-airflow', 'python', 'scheduler']","# Apache Airflow []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( [Apache Airflow]( (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative. Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed. **Table of contents** - [Project Focus](#project-focus) - [Principles](#principles) - [Requirements](#requirements) - [Getting started](#getting-started) - [Installing from PyPI](#installing-from-pypi) - [Official source code](#official-source-code) - [Convenience packages](#convenience-packages) - [User Interface](#user-interface) - [Semantic versioning](#semantic-versioning) - [Version Life Cycle](#version-life-cycle) - [Support for Python and Kubernetes versions](#support-for-python-and-kubernetes-versions) - [Base OS support for reference Airflow images](#base-os-support-for-reference-airflow-images) - [Approach to dependencies of Airflow](#approach-to-dependencies-of-airflow) - [Contributing](#contributing) - [Voting Policy](#voting-policy) - [Who uses Apache Airflow?](#who-uses-apache-airflow) - [Who maintains Apache Airflow?](#who-maintains-apache-airflow) - [What goes into the next release?](#what-goes-into-the-next-release) - [Can I use the Apache Airflow logo in my presentation?](#can-i-use-the-apache-airflow-logo-in-my-presentation) - [Links](#links) - [Sponsors](#sponsors) ## Project Focus Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the DAG structure is similar from one run to the next, it clarifies the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include [Luigi]( [Oozie]( and [Azkaban]( Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's [XCom feature]( For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work. Airflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches. ## Principles - **Dynamic**: Airflow pipelines are configuration as code (Python), allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically. - **Extensible**: Easily define your own operators, executors and extend the library so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment. - **Elegant**: Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parameterizing your scripts is built into the core of Airflow using the powerful **Jinja** templating engine. - **Scalable**: Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. ## Requirements Apache Airflow is tested with: | | Main version (dev) | Stable version (2.9.1) | |-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------| | Python | 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 | | Platform | AMD64/ARM64(\*) | AMD64/ARM64(\*) | | Kubernetes | 1.26, 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, 1.30 | 1.26, 1.27, 1.28, 1.29 | | PostgreSQL | 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 | 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 | | MySQL | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation | 8.0, Innovation | | SQLite | 3.15.0+ | 3.15.0+ | \* Experimental **Note**: MySQL 5.x versions are unable to or have limitations with running multiple schedulers -- please see the [Scheduler docs]( MariaDB is not tested/recommended. **Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development. **Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS. On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers. The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388]( but it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as ""Production"" execution environment as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image]( is `Debian Bookworm`. We also have support for legacy ``Debian Bullseye`` base image if you want to build a custom image but it is deprecated and option to do it will be removed in the Dockerfile that will accompany Airflow 2.9.1 so you are advised to switch to ``Debian Bookworm`` for your custom images. ## Getting started Visit the official Airflow website documentation (latest **stable** release) for help with [installing Airflow]( [getting started]( or walking through a more complete [tutorial]( > Note: If you're looking for documentation for the main branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs]( For more information on Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit the [Airflow Wiki]( Documentation for dependent projects like provider packages, Docker image, Helm Chart, you'll find it in [the documentation index]( ## Installing from PyPI We publish Apache Airflow as `apache-airflow` package in PyPI. Installing it however might be sometimes tricky because Airflow is a bit of both a library and application. Libraries usually keep their dependencies open, and applications usually pin them, but we should do neither and both simultaneously. We decided to keep our dependencies as open as possible (in `pyproject.toml`) so users can install different versions of libraries if needed. This means that `pip install apache-airflow` will not work from time to time or will produce unusable Airflow installation. To have repeatable installation, however, we keep a set of ""known-to-be-working"" constraint files in the orphan `constraints-main` and `constraints-2-0` branches. We keep those ""known-to-be-working"" constraints files separately per major/minor Python version. You can use them as constraint files when installing Airflow from PyPI. Note that you have to specify correct Airflow tag/version/branch and Python versions in the URL. 1. Installing just Airflow: > Note: Only `pip` installation is currently officially supported. While it is possible to install Airflow with tools like [Poetry]( or [pip-tools]( they do not share the same workflow as `pip` - especially when it comes to constraint vs. requirements management. Installing via `Poetry` or `pip-tools` is not currently supported. There are known issues with ``bazel`` that might lead to circular dependencies when using it to install Airflow. Please switch to ``pip`` if you encounter such problems. ``Bazel`` community works on fixing the problem in `this PR `_ so it might be that newer versions of ``bazel`` will handle it. If you wish to install Airflow using those tools, you should use the constraint files and convert them to the appropriate format and workflow that your tool requires. ```bash pip install 'apache-airflow==2.9.1' \ --constraint "" ``` 2. Installing with extras (i.e., postgres, google) ```bash pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==2.8.3' \ --constraint "" ``` For information on installing provider packages, check [providers]( ## Official source code Apache Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation]( (ASF) project, and our official source code releases: - Follow the [ASF Release Policy]( - Can be downloaded from [the ASF Distribution Directory]( - Are cryptographically signed by the release manager - Are officially voted on by the PMC members during the [Release Approval Process]( Following the ASF rules, the source packages released must be sufficient for a user to build and test the release provided they have access to the appropriate platform and tools. ## Convenience packages There are other ways of installing and using Airflow. Those are ""convenience"" methods - they are not ""official releases"" as stated by the `ASF Release Policy`, but they can be used by the users who do not want to build the software themselves. Those are - in the order of most common ways people install Airflow: - [PyPI releases]( to install Airflow using standard `pip` tool - [Docker Images]( to install airflow via `docker` tool, use them in Kubernetes, Helm Charts, `docker-compose`, `docker swarm`, etc. You can read more about using, customising, and extending the images in the [Latest docs]( and learn details on the internals in the [images]( document. - [Tags in GitHub]( to retrieve the git project sources that were used to generate official source packages via git All those artifacts are not official releases, but they are prepared using officially released sources. Some of those artifacts are ""development"" or ""pre-release"" ones, and they are clearly marked as such following the ASF Policy. ## User Interface - **DAGs**: Overview of all DAGs in your environment. - **Grid**: Grid representation of a DAG that spans across time. - **Graph**: Visualization of a DAG's dependencies and their current status for a specific run. - **Task Duration**: Total time spent on different tasks over time. - **Gantt**: Duration and overlap of a DAG. - **Code**: Quick way to view source code of a DAG. ## Semantic versioning As of Airflow 2.0.0, we support a strict [SemVer]( approach for all packages released.

The library covers LLM-based applications such as RAG agents, all the way to traditional ML models for tabular data. ## Scan: Automatically assess your LLM-based agents for performance, bias & security issues Issues detected include: - Hallucinations - Harmful content generation - Prompt injection - Robustness issues - Sensitive information disclosure - Stereotypes & discrimination - many more... ## RAG Evaluation Toolkit (RAGET): Automatically generate evaluation datasets & evaluate RAG application answers If you're testing a RAG application, you can get an even more in-depth assessment using **RAGET**, Giskard's RAG Evaluation Toolkit. - **RAGET** can generate automatically a list of `question`, `reference_answer` and `reference_context` from the knowledge base of the RAG. You can then use this generated test set to evaluate your RAG agent. - **RAGET** computes scores *for each component of the RAG agent*. The scores are computed by aggregating the correctness of the agents answers on different question types. - Here is the list of components evaluated with **RAGET**: - `Generator`: the LLM used inside the RAG to generate the answers - `Retriever`: fetch relevant documents from the knowledge base according to a user query - `Rewriter`: rewrite the user query to make it more relevant to the knowledge base or to account for chat history - `Router`: filter the query of the user based on his intentions - `Knowledge Base`: the set of documents given to the RAG to generate the answers Giskard works with any model, in any environment and integrates seamlessly with your favorite tools # Contents - **[Quickstart](#quickstart)** - **1**.

[Automatically generate an evaluation dataset for your RAG applications](#automatically-generate-an-evaluation-dataset-for-your-rag-applications) - **[Community](#community)** Quickstart 1. Build a LLM agent Let's build an agent that answers questions about climate change, based on the 2023 Climate Change Synthesis Report by the IPCC. Before starting let's install the required libraries: ```sh pip install langchain tiktoken ""pypdf<=3.17.0"" ``` ```python from langchain import OpenAI, FAISS, PromptTemplate from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter # Prepare vector store (FAISS) with IPPC report text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100, add_start_index=True) loader = PyPDFLoader("" db = FAISS.from_documents(loader.load_and_split(text_splitter), OpenAIEmbeddings()) # Prepare QA chain PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """"""You are the Climate Assistant, a helpful AI assistant made by Giskard. Your task is to answer common questions on climate change. You will be given a question and relevant excerpts from the IPCC Climate Change Synthesis Report (2023). Please provide short and clear answers based on the provided context. Be polite and helpful. Context: {context} Question: {question} Your answer: """""" llm = OpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct"", temperature=0) prompt = PromptTemplate(template=PROMPT_TEMPLATE, input_variables=[""question"", ""context""]) climate_qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=llm, retriever=db.as_retriever(), prompt=prompt) ``` 2. Scan your model for issues Next, wrap your agent to prepare it for Giskard's scan: ```python import giskard import pandas as pd def model_predict(df: pd.DataFrame): """"""Wraps the LLM call in a simple Python function. The function takes a pandas.DataFrame containing the input variables needed by your model, and must return a list of the outputs (one for each row). """""" return [climate_qa_chain.run({""query"": question}) for question in df[""question""]] # Dont forget to fill the `name` and `description`: they are used by Giskard # to generate domain-specific tests. giskard_model = giskard.Model( model=model_predict, model_type=""text_generation"", name=""Climate Change Question Answering"", description=""This model answers any question about climate change based on IPCC reports"", feature_names=[""question""], ) ``` Then run Giskard's magical scan ```python scan_results = giskard.scan(giskard_model) ``` Once the scan completes, you can display the results directly in your notebook: ```python display(scan_results) # Or save it to a file scan_results.to_html(""scan_results.html"") ``` *If you're facing issues, check out our [docs]( for more information.* 3. Automatically generate an evaluation dataset for your RAG applications If the scan found issues in your model, you can automatically extract an evaluation dataset based on the issues found: ```python test_suite = scan_results.generate_test_suite(""My first test suite"") ``` By default, RAGET automatically generates 6 different question types (these can be selected if needed, see advanced question generation). The total number of questions is divided equally between each question type. To make the question generation more relevant and accurate, you can also provide a description of your agent. ```python from giskard.rag import generate_testset, KnowledgeBase # Load your data and initialize the KnowledgeBase df = pd.read_csv(""path/to/your/knowledge_base.csv"") knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase.from_pandas(df, columns=[""column_1"", ""column_2""]) # Generate a testset with 10 questions & answers for each question types (this will take a while) testset = generate_testset( knowledge_base, num_questions=60, language='en', # optional, we'll auto detect if not provided agent_description=""A customer support chatbot for company X"", # helps generating better questions ) ``` Depending on how many questions you generate, this can take a while. Once youre done, you can save this generated test set for future use: ```python # Save the generated testset testset.save(""my_testset.jsonl"") ``` You can easily load it back ```python from giskard.rag import QATestset loaded_testset = QATestset.load(""my_testset.jsonl"") # Convert it to a pandas dataframe df = loaded_testset.to_pandas() ``` Heres an example of a generated question: | question | reference_context | reference_answer | metadata | |----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------| | For which countries can I track my shipping? | Document 1: We offer free shipping on all orders over $50.

transformers,huggingface/transformers,126658,"['Python', 'Cuda', 'Dockerfile']","['nlp', 'natural-language-processing', 'pytorch', 'language-model', 'tensorflow']","English | | | | Espaol | | | | ortugus | | Franais | Deutsch | Ting Vit | State-of-the-art Machine Learning for JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio. These models can be applied on: * Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and text generation, in over 100 languages. * Images, for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. * Audio, for tasks like speech recognition and audio classification. Transformer models can also perform tasks on **several modalities combined**, such as table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering. Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets and then share them with the community on our [model hub]( At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments. Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries [Jax]( [PyTorch]( and [TensorFlow]( with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other. ## Online demos You can test most of our models directly on their pages from the [model hub]( We also offer [private model hosting, versioning, & an inference API]( for public and private models. Here are a few examples: In Natural Language Processing: - [Masked word completion with BERT]( - [Named Entity Recognition with Electra]( - [Text generation with Mistral]( - [Natural Language Inference with RoBERTa]( - [Summarization with BART]( - [Question answering with DistilBERT]( - [Translation with T5]( In Computer Vision: - [Image classification with ViT]( - [Object Detection with DETR]( - [Semantic Segmentation with SegFormer]( - [Panoptic Segmentation with Mask2Former]( - [Depth Estimation with Depth Anything]( - [Video Classification with VideoMAE]( - [Universal Segmentation with OneFormer]( In Audio: - [Automatic Speech Recognition with Whisper]( - [Keyword Spotting with Wav2Vec2]( - [Audio Classification with Audio Spectrogram Transformer]( In Multimodal tasks: - [Table Question Answering with TAPAS]( - [Visual Question Answering with ViLT]( - [Image captioning with LLaVa]( - [Zero-shot Image Classification with SigLIP]( - [Document Question Answering with LayoutLM]( - [Zero-shot Video Classification with X-CLIP]( - [Zero-shot Object Detection with OWLv2]( - [Zero-shot Image Segmentation with CLIPSeg]( - [Automatic Mask Generation with SAM]( ## 100 projects using Transformers Transformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models: it's a community of projects built around it and the Hugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone else to build their dream projects. In order to celebrate the 100,000 stars of transformers, we have decided to put the spotlight on the community, and we have created the [awesome-transformers](./awesome-transformers.md) page which lists 100 incredible projects built in the vicinity of transformers. If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it! ## If you are looking for custom support from the Hugging Face team ## Quick tour To immediately use a model on a given input (text, image, audio, ...), we provide the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model's training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts: ```python >>> from transformers import pipeline # Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis >>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis') >>> classifier('We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.') [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996980428695679}] ``` The second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the third evaluates it on the given text. Here, the answer is ""positive"" with a confidence of 99.97%. Many tasks have a pre-trained `pipeline` ready to go, in NLP but also in computer vision and speech. For example, we can easily extract detected objects in an image: ``` python >>> import requests >>> from PIL import Image >>> from transformers import pipeline # Download an image with cute cats >>> url = "" >>> image_data = requests.get(url, stream=True).raw >>> image = Image.open(image_data) # Allocate a pipeline for object detection >>> object_detector = pipeline('object-detection') >>> object_detector(image) [{'score': 0.9982201457023621, 'label': 'remote', 'box': {'xmin': 40, 'ymin': 70, 'xmax': 175, 'ymax': 117}}, {'score': 0.9960021376609802, 'label': 'remote', 'box': {'xmin': 333, 'ymin': 72, 'xmax': 368, 'ymax': 187}}, {'score': 0.9954745173454285, 'label': 'couch', 'box': {'xmin': 0, 'ymin': 1, 'xmax': 639, 'ymax': 473}}, {'score': 0.9988006353378296, 'label': 'cat', 'box': {'xmin': 13, 'ymin': 52, 'xmax': 314, 'ymax': 470}}, {'score': 0.9986783862113953, 'label': 'cat', 'box': {'xmin': 345, 'ymin': 23, 'xmax': 640, 'ymax': 368}}] ``` Here, we get a list of objects detected in the image, with a box surrounding the object and a confidence score. Here is the original image on the left, with the predictions displayed on the right: You can learn more about the tasks supported by the `pipeline` API in [this tutorial]( In addition to `pipeline`, to download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, all it takes is three lines of code. Here is the PyTorch version: ```python >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""google-bert/bert-base-uncased"") >>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(""google-bert/bert-base-uncased"") >>> inputs = tokenizer(""Hello world!"", return_tensors=""pt"") >>> outputs = model(**inputs) ``` And here is the equivalent code for TensorFlow: ```python >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""google-bert/bert-base-uncased"") >>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(""google-bert/bert-base-uncased"") >>> inputs = tokenizer(""Hello world!"", return_tensors=""tf"") >>> outputs = model(**inputs) ``` The tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator. The model itself is a regular [Pytorch `nn.Module`]( or a [TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model`]( (depending on your backend) which you can use as usual. [This tutorial]( explains how to integrate such a model into a classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our `Trainer` API to quickly fine-tune on a new dataset. ## Why should I use transformers? 1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models: - High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks. - Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners. - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn. - A unified API for using all our pretrained models. 1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint: - Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining. - Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs. - Dozens of architectures with over 400,000 pretrained models across all modalities. 1. Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime: - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code. - Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will. - Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production. 1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs: - We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors. - Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible. - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments. ## Why shouldn't I use transformers? - This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files. - The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library (possibly, [Accelerate]( - While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our [examples folder]( are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the-box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs. ## Installation ### With pip This repository is tested on Python 3.8+, Flax 0.4.1+, PyTorch 1.11+, and TensorFlow 2.6+. You should install Transformers in a [virtual environment]( If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide]( First, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it. Then, you will need to install at least one of Flax, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. Please refer to [TensorFlow installation page]( [PyTorch installation page]( and/or [Flax]( and [Jax]( installation pages regarding the specific installation command for your platform. When one of those backends has been installed, Transformers can be installed using pip as follows: ```bash pip install transformers ``` If you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for ...

It's an open-source tool that uses Yahoo's publicly available APIs, and is intended for research and educational purposes. **You should refer to Yahoo!'s terms of use** ([here]( [here]( and [here]( **for details on your rights to use the actual data downloaded. Remember - the Yahoo! finance API is intended for personal use only.** --- **yfinance** offers a threaded and Pythonic way to download market data from [Yahoo! finance]( Check out this [Blog post]( for a detailed tutorial with code examples. [Changelog ]( --- - [Installation](#installation) - [Quick start](#quick-start) - [Advanced](#logging) - [Wiki]( - [Contribute](#developers-want-to-contribute) --- ## Installation Install `yfinance` using `pip`: ``` {.sourceCode .bash} $ pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir ``` [With Conda]( To install with optional dependencies, replace `optional` with: `nospam` for [caching-requests](#smarter-scraping), `repair` for [price repair]( or `nospam,repair` for both: ``` {.sourceCode .bash} $ pip install ""yfinance[optional]"" ``` [Required dependencies](./requirements.txt) , [all dependencies](./setup.py#L62). --- ## Quick Start ### The Ticker module The `Ticker` module, which allows you to access ticker data in a more Pythonic way: ```python import yfinance as yf msft = yf.Ticker(""MSFT"") # get all stock info msft.info # get historical market data hist = msft.history(period=""1mo"") # show meta information about the history (requires history() to be called first) msft.history_metadata # show actions (dividends, splits, capital gains) msft.actions msft.dividends msft.splits msft.capital_gains # only for mutual funds & etfs # show share count msft.get_shares_full(start=""2022-01-01"", end=None) # show financials: # - income statement msft.income_stmt msft.quarterly_income_stmt # - balance sheet msft.balance_sheet msft.quarterly_balance_sheet # - cash flow statement msft.cashflow msft.quarterly_cashflow # see `Ticker.get_income_stmt()` for more options # show holders msft.major_holders msft.institutional_holders msft.mutualfund_holders msft.insider_transactions msft.insider_purchases msft.insider_roster_holders # show recommendations msft.recommendations msft.recommendations_summary msft.upgrades_downgrades # Show future and historic earnings dates, returns at most next 4 quarters and last 8 quarters by default. # Note: If more are needed use msft.get_earnings_dates(limit=XX) with increased limit argument. msft.earnings_dates # show ISIN code - *experimental* # ISIN = International Securities Identification Number msft.isin # show options expirations msft.options # show news msft.news # get option chain for specific expiration opt = msft.option_chain('YYYY-MM-DD') # data available via: opt.calls, opt.puts ``` If you want to use a proxy server for downloading data, use: ```python import yfinance as yf msft = yf.Ticker(""MSFT"") msft.history(..., proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") msft.get_actions(proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") msft.get_dividends(proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") msft.get_splits(proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") msft.get_capital_gains(proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") msft.get_balance_sheet(proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") msft.get_cashflow(proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") msft.option_chain(..., proxy=""PROXY_SERVER"") ... ``` ### Multiple tickers To initialize multiple `Ticker` objects, use ```python import yfinance as yf tickers = yf.Tickers('msft aapl goog') # access each ticker using (example) tickers.tickers['MSFT'].info tickers.tickers['AAPL'].history(period=""1mo"") tickers.tickers['GOOG'].actions ``` To download price history into one table: ```python import yfinance as yf data = yf.download(""SPY AAPL"", period=""1mo"") ``` #### `yf.download()` and `Ticker.history()` have many options for configuring fetching and processing. [Review the Wiki]( for more options and detail. ### Logging `yfinance` now uses the `logging` module to handle messages, default behaviour is only print errors. If debugging, use `yf.enable_debug_mode()` to switch logging to debug with custom formatting. ### Smarter scraping Install the `nospam` packages for smarter scraping using `pip` (see [Installation](#installation)). These packages help cache calls such that Yahoo is not spammed with requests. To use a custom `requests` session, pass a `session=` argument to the Ticker constructor. This allows for caching calls to the API as well as a custom way to modify requests via the `User-agent` header. ```python import requests_cache session = requests_cache.CachedSession('yfinance.cache') session.headers['User-agent'] = 'my-program/1.0' ticker = yf.Ticker('msft', session=session) # The scraped response will be stored in the cache ticker.actions ``` Combine `requests_cache` with rate-limiting to avoid triggering Yahoo's rate-limiter/blocker that can corrupt data. ```python from requests import Session from requests_cache import CacheMixin, SQLiteCache from requests_ratelimiter import LimiterMixin, MemoryQueueBucket from pyrate_limiter import Duration, RequestRate, Limiter class CachedLimiterSession(CacheMixin, LimiterMixin, Session): pass session = CachedLimiterSession( limiter=Limiter(RequestRate(2, Duration.SECOND*5)), # max 2 requests per 5 seconds bucket_class=MemoryQueueBucket, backend=SQLiteCache(""yfinance.cache""), ) ``` ### Managing Multi-Level Columns The following answer on Stack Overflow is for [How to deal with multi-level column names downloaded with yfinance?]( - `yfinance` returns a `pandas.DataFrame` with multi-level column names, with a level for the ticker and a level for the stock price data - The answer discusses: - How to correctly read the the multi-level columns after saving the dataframe to a csv with `pandas.DataFrame.to_csv` - How to download single or multiple tickers into a single dataframe with single level column names and a ticker column ### Persistent cache store To reduce Yahoo, yfinance store some data locally: timezones to localize dates, and cookie. Cache location is: - Windows = C:/Users/\/AppData/Local/py-yfinance - Linux = /home/\/.cache/py-yfinance - MacOS = /Users/\/Library/Caches/py-yfinance You can direct cache to use a different location with `set_tz_cache_location()`: ```python import yfinance as yf yf.set_tz_cache_location(""custom/cache/location"") ... ``` --- ## Developers: want to contribute? `yfinance` relies on community to investigate bugs and contribute code.

diffusers,huggingface/diffusers,23024,"['Python', 'Dockerfile', 'Makefile']","['deep-learning', 'diffusion', 'image-generation', 'pytorch', 'score-based-generative-modeling']","Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether you're looking for a simple inference solution or training your own diffusion models, Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance]( [simple over easy]( and [customizability over abstractions]( Diffusers offers three core components: - State-of-the-art [diffusion pipelines]( that can be run in inference with just a few lines of code. - Interchangeable noise [schedulers]( for different diffusion speeds and output quality. - Pretrained [models]( that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems. ## Installation We recommend installing Diffusers in a virtual environment from PyPI or Conda. For more details about installing [PyTorch]( and [Flax]( please refer to their official documentation. ### PyTorch With `pip` (official package): ```bash pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch] ``` With `conda` (maintained by the community): ```sh conda install -c conda-forge diffusers ``` ### Flax With `pip` (official package): ```bash pip install --upgrade diffusers[flax] ``` ### Apple Silicon (M1/M2) support Please refer to the [How to use Stable Diffusion in Apple Silicon]( guide. ## Quickstart Generating outputs is super easy with Diffusers. To generate an image from text, use the `from_pretrained` method to load any pretrained diffusion model (browse the [Hub]( for 25.000+ checkpoints): ```python from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline import torch pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"", torch_dtype=torch.float16) pipeline.to(""cuda"") pipeline(""An image of a squirrel in Picasso style"").images[0] ``` You can also dig into the models and schedulers toolbox to build your own diffusion system: ```python from diffusers import DDPMScheduler, UNet2DModel from PIL import Image import torch scheduler = DDPMScheduler.from_pretrained(""google/ddpm-cat-256"") model = UNet2DModel.from_pretrained(""google/ddpm-cat-256"").to(""cuda"") scheduler.set_timesteps(50) sample_size = model.config.sample_size noise = torch.randn((1, 3, sample_size, sample_size), device=""cuda"") input = noise for t in scheduler.timesteps: with torch.no_grad(): noisy_residual = model(input, t).sample prev_noisy_sample = scheduler.step(noisy_residual, t, input).prev_sample input = prev_noisy_sample image = (input / 2 + 0.5).clamp(0, 1) image = image.cpu().permute(0, 2, 3, 1).numpy()[0] image = Image.fromarray((image * 255).round().astype(""uint8"")) image ``` Check out the [Quickstart]( to launch your diffusion journey today! ## How to navigate the documentation | **Documentation** | **What can I learn?** | |---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | [Tutorial]( | A basic crash course for learning how to use the library's most important features like using models and schedulers to build your own diffusion system, and training your own diffusion model. | | [Loading]( | Guides for how to load and configure all the components (pipelines, models, and schedulers) of the library, as well as how to use different schedulers. | | [Pipelines for inference]( | Guides for how to use pipelines for different inference tasks, batched generation, controlling generated outputs and randomness, and how to contribute a pipeline to the library. | | [Optimization]( | Guides for how to optimize your diffusion model to run faster and consume less memory. | | [Training]( | Guides for how to train a diffusion model for different tasks with different training techniques. | ## Contribution We contributions from the open-source community!

nerfstudio,nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio,8674,"['Python', 'JavaScript', 'TypeScript']","['nerf', 'pytorch', '3d', '3d-graphics', '3d-reconstruction']","A collaboration friendly studio for NeRFs - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Learn more](#learn-more) - [Supported Features](#supported-features) # About _Its as simple as plug and play with nerfstudio!_ Nerfstudio provides a simple API that allows for a simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and testing NeRFs. The library supports a **more interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component.** With more modular NeRFs, we hope to create a more user-friendly experience in exploring the technology. This is a contributor-friendly repo with the goal of building a community where users can more easily build upon each other's contributions. Nerfstudio initially launched as an opensource project by Berkeley students in [KAIR lab]( at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)]( in October 2022 as a part of a research project ([paper]( It is currently developed by Berkeley students and community contributors. We are committed to providing learning resources to help you understand the basics of (if you're just getting started), and keep up-to-date with (if you're a seasoned veteran) all things NeRF. As researchers, we know just how hard it is to get onboarded with this next-gen technology. So we're here to help with tutorials, documentation, and more! Have feature requests? Want to add your brand-spankin'-new NeRF model? Have a new dataset? **We welcome [contributions]( Please do not hesitate to reach out to the nerfstudio team with any questions via [Discord]( Have feedback? We'd love for you to fill out our [Nerfstudio Feedback Form]( if you want to let us know who you are, why you are interested in Nerfstudio, or provide any feedback! We hope nerfstudio enables you to build faster :hammer: learn together :books: and contribute to our NeRF community :sparkling_heart:. ## Sponsors Sponsors of this work includes [Luma AI]( and the [BAIR commons]( # Quickstart The quickstart will help you get started with the default vanilla NeRF trained on the classic Blender Lego scene. For more complex changes (e.g., running with your own data/setting up a new NeRF graph), please refer to our [references](#learn-more). ## 1. Installation: Setup the environment ### Prerequisites You must have an NVIDIA video card with CUDA installed on the system. This library has been tested with version 11.8 of CUDA. You can find more information about installing CUDA [here]( ### Create environment Nerfstudio requires `python >= 3.8`. We recommend using conda to manage dependencies. Make sure to install [Conda]( before proceeding. ```bash conda create --name nerfstudio -y python=3.8 conda activate nerfstudio pip install --upgrade pip ``` ### Dependencies Install PyTorch with CUDA (this repo has been tested with CUDA 11.7 and CUDA 11.8) and [tiny-cuda-nn]( `cuda-toolkit` is required for building `tiny-cuda-nn`. For CUDA 11.8: ```bash pip install torch==2.1.2+cu118 torchvision==0.16.2+cu118 --extra-index-url conda install -c ""nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0"" cuda-toolkit pip install ninja git+ ``` See [Dependencies]( in the Installation documentation for more. ### Installing nerfstudio Easy option: ```bash pip install nerfstudio ``` **OR** if you want the latest and greatest: ```bash git clone cd nerfstudio pip install --upgrade pip setuptools pip install -e . ``` **OR** if you want to skip all installation steps and directly start using nerfstudio, use the docker image: See [Installation]( - **Use docker image**. ## 2. Training your first model! The following will train a _nerfacto_ model, our recommended model for real world scenes. ```bash # Download some test data: ns-download-data nerfstudio --capture-name=poster # Train model ns-train nerfacto --data data/nerfstudio/poster ``` If everything works, you should see training progress like the following: Navigating to the link at the end of the terminal will load the webviewer. If you are running on a remote machine, you will need to port forward the websocket port (defaults to 7007). ### Resume from checkpoint / visualize existing run It is possible to load a pretrained model by running ```bash ns-train nerfacto --data data/nerfstudio/poster --load-dir {outputs/.../nerfstudio_models} ``` ## Visualize existing run Given a pretrained model checkpoint, you can start the viewer by running ```bash ns-viewer --load-config {outputs/.../config.yml} ``` ## 3. Exporting Results Once you have a NeRF model you can either render out a video or export a point cloud. ### Render Video First we must create a path for the camera to follow. This can be done in the viewer under the ""RENDER"" tab. Orient your 3D view to the location where you wish the video to start, then press ""ADD CAMERA"". This will set the first camera key frame. Continue to new viewpoints adding additional cameras to create the camera path. We provide other parameters to further refine your camera path. Once satisfied, press ""RENDER"" which will display a modal that contains the command needed to render the video. Kill the training job (or create a new terminal if you have lots of compute) and run the command to generate the video. Other video export options are available, learn more by running ```bash ns-render --help ``` ### Generate Point Cloud While NeRF models are not designed to generate point clouds, it is still possible. Navigate to the ""EXPORT"" tab in the 3D viewer and select ""POINT CLOUD"". If the crop option is selected, everything in the yellow square will be exported into a point cloud. Modify the settings as desired then run the command at the bottom of the panel in your command line. Alternatively you can use the CLI without the viewer. Learn about the export options by running ```bash ns-export pointcloud --help ``` ## 4. Using Custom Data Using an existing dataset is great, but likely you want to use your own data! We support various methods for using your own data. Before it can be used in nerfstudio, the camera location and orientations must be determined and then converted into our format using `ns-process-data`. We rely on external tools for this, instructions and information can be found in the documentation. | Data | Capture Device | Requirements | `ns-process-data` Speed | | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | | [Images]( | Any | [COLMAP]( | | | [Video]( | Any | [COLMAP]( | | | [360 Data]( | Any | [COLMAP]( | | | [Polycam]( | IOS with LiDAR | [Polycam App]( | | | [KIRI Engine]( | IOS or Android | [KIRI Engine App]( | | | [Record3D]( | IOS with LiDAR | [Record3D app]( | | | [Spectacular AI]( | IOS, OAK, [others]( | [App]( / [`sai-cli`]( | | | [Metashape]( | Any | [Metashape]( | | | [RealityCapture]( | Any | [RealityCapture]( | | | [ODM]( | Any | [ODM]( | | | [Aria]( | Aria glasses | [Project Aria]( | | | [Custom]( | Any | Camera Poses | | ## 5. Advanced Options ### Training models other than nerfacto We provide other models than nerfacto, for example if you want to train the original nerf model, use the following command ```bash ns-train vanilla-nerf --data DATA_PATH ``` For a full list of included models run `ns-train --help`. ### Modify Configuration Each model contains many parameters that can be changed, too many to list here. Use the `--help` command to see the full list of configuration options. ```bash ns-train nerfacto --help ``` ### Tensorboard / WandB / Viewer We support four different methods to track training progress, using the viewer[tensorboard]( [Weights and Biases]( and ,[Comet]( You can specify which visualizer to use by appending `--vis {viewer, tensorboard, wandb, comet viewer+wandb, viewer+tensorboard, viewer+comet}` to the training command. Simultaneously utilizing the viewer alongside wandb or tensorboard may cause stuttering issues during evaluation steps. The viewer only works for methods that are fast (ie. nerfacto, instant-ngp), for slower methods like NeRF, use the other loggers. # Learn More And that's it for getting started with the basics of nerfstudio.

dgl,dmlc/dgl,13081,"['Python', 'C++', 'Jupyter Notebook']","['deep-learning', 'graph-neural-networks']","[]( []( []( []( [](./LICENSE) []( [Website]( | [A Blitz Introduction to DGL]( | Documentation ([Latest]( | [Stable]( | [Official Examples](examples/README.md) | [Discussion Forum]( | [Slack Channel]( DGL is an easy-to-use, high performance and scalable Python package for deep learning on graphs. DGL is framework agnostic, meaning if a deep graph model is a component of an end-to-end application, the rest of the logics can be implemented in any major frameworks, such as PyTorch, Apache MXNet or TensorFlow. Figure: DGL Overall Architecture ## Highlighted Features ### A GPU-ready graph library DGL provides a powerful graph object that can reside on either CPU or GPU. It bundles structural data as well as features for better control. We provide a variety of functions for computing with graph objects including efficient and customizable message passing primitives for Graph Neural Networks. ### A versatile tool for GNN researchers and practitioners The field of graph deep learning is still rapidly evolving and many research ideas emerge by standing on the shoulders of giants. To ease the process, [DGl-Go]( is a command-line interface to get started with training, using and studying state-of-the-art GNNs. DGL collects a rich set of [example implementations]( of popular GNN models of a wide range of topics. Researchers can [search]( for related models to innovate new ideas from or use them as baselines for experiments. Moreover, DGL provides many state-of-the-art [GNN layers and modules]( for users to build new model architectures. DGL is one of the preferred platforms for many standard graph deep learning benchmarks including [OGB]( and [GNNBenchmarks]( ### Easy to learn and use DGL provides plenty of learning materials for all kinds of users from ML researchers to domain experts. The [Blitz Introduction to DGL]( is a 120-minute tour of the basics of graph machine learning. The [User Guide]( explains in more details the concepts of graphs as well as the training methodology. All of them include code snippets in DGL that are runnable and ready to be plugged into ones own pipeline. ### Scalable and efficient It is convenient to train models using DGL on large-scale graphs across **multiple GPUs** or **multiple machines**. DGL extensively optimizes the whole stack to reduce the overhead in communication, memory consumption and synchronization. As a result, DGL can easily scale to billion-sized graphs. Get started with the [tutorials]( and [user guide]( for distributed training. See the [system performance note]( for the comparison with other tools. ## Get Started Users can install DGL from [pip and conda]( You can also download GPU enabled DGL docker [containers]( (backended by PyTorch) from NVIDIA NGC for both x86 and ARM based linux systems. Advanced users can follow the [instructions]( to install from source.

We also show you how to use the code in Docker, and on Google Colab. # Why use DeepLabCut? In 2018, we demonstrated the capabilities for [trail tracking]( [reaching in mice]( and various Drosophila behaviors during egg-laying (see [Mathis et al.]( for details). There is, however, nothing specific that makes the toolbox only applicable to these tasks and/or species. The toolbox has already been successfully applied (by us and others) to [rats]( humans, various fish species, bacteria, leeches, various robots, cheetahs, [mouse whiskers]( and [race horses]( DeepLabCut utilized the feature detectors (ResNets + readout layers) of one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for human pose estimation by Insafutdinov et al., called DeeperCut, which inspired the name for our toolbox (see references below). Since this time, the package has changed substantially. The code has been re-tooled and re-factored since 2.1+: We have added faster and higher performance variants with MobileNetV2s, EfficientNets, and our own DLCRNet backbones (see [Pretraining boosts out-of-domain robustness for pose estimation]( and [Lauer et al 2022]( Additionally, we have improved the inference speed and provided both additional and novel augmentation methods, added real-time, and multi-animal support. We currently provide state-of-the-art performance for animal pose estimation. **Left:** Due to transfer learning it requires **little training data** for multiple, challenging behaviors (see [Mathis et al. 2018]( for details). **Mid Left:** The feature detectors are robust to video compression (see [Mathis/Warren]( for details). **Mid Right:** It allows 3D pose estimation with a single network and camera (see [Mathis/Warren]( **Right:** It allows 3D pose estimation with a single network trained on data from multiple cameras together with standard triangulation methods (see [Nath* and Mathis* et al. 2019]( **DeepLabCut** is embedding in a larger open-source eco-system, providing behavioral tracking for neuroscience, ecology, medical, and technical applications.

llama_index,run-llama/llama_index,32030,"['Python', 'Jupyter Notebook', 'Makefile']","['agents', 'application', 'data', 'fine-tuning', 'framework']","# LlamaIndex []( []( []( []( LlamaIndex (GPT Index) is a data framework for your LLM application. Building with LlamaIndex typically involves working with LlamaIndex core and a chosen set of integrations (or plugins). There are two ways to start building with LlamaIndex in Python: 1. **Starter**: `llama-index` ( A starter Python package that includes core LlamaIndex as well as a selection of integrations. 2. **Customized**: `llama-index-core` ( Install core LlamaIndex and add your chosen LlamaIndex integration packages on [LlamaHub]( that are required for your application. There are over 300 LlamaIndex integration packages that work seamlessly with core, allowing you to build with your preferred LLM, embedding, and vector store providers. The LlamaIndex Python library is namespaced such that import statements which include `core` imply that the core package is being used. In contrast, those statements without `core` imply that an integration package is being used. ```python # typical pattern from llama_index.core.xxx import ClassABC # core submodule xxx from llama_index.xxx.yyy import ( SubclassABC, ) # integration yyy for submodule xxx # concrete example from llama_index.core.llms import LLM from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI ``` ### Important Links LlamaIndex.TS (Typescript/Javascript): Documentation: Twitter: Discord: ### Ecosystem - LlamaHub (community library of data loaders): - LlamaLab (cutting-edge AGI projects using LlamaIndex): ## Overview **NOTE**: This README is not updated as frequently as the documentation. Please check out the documentation above for the latest updates! ### Context - LLMs are a phenomenal piece of technology for knowledge generation and reasoning. They are pre-trained on large amounts of publicly available data. - How do we best augment LLMs with our own private data? We need a comprehensive toolkit to help perform this data augmentation for LLMs. ### Proposed Solution That's where **LlamaIndex** comes in. LlamaIndex is a ""data framework"" to help you build LLM apps. It provides the following tools: - Offers **data connectors** to ingest your existing data sources and data formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.). - Provides ways to **structure your data** (indices, graphs) so that this data can be easily used with LLMs. - Provides an **advanced retrieval/query interface over your data**: Feed in any LLM input prompt, get back retrieved context and knowledge-augmented output. - Allows easy integrations with your outer application framework (e.g. with LangChain, Flask, Docker, ChatGPT, anything else). LlamaIndex provides tools for both beginner users and advanced users. Our high-level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in 5 lines of code. Our lower-level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module (data connectors, indices, retrievers, query engines, reranking modules), to fit their needs. ## Contributing Interested in contributing? Contributions to LlamaIndex core as well as contributing integrations that build on the core are both accepted and highly encouraged! See our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details. ## Documentation Full documentation can be found here: Please check it out for the most up-to-date tutorials, how-to guides, references, and other resources! ## Example Usage ```sh # custom selection of integrations to work with core pip install llama-index-core pip install llama-index-llms-openai pip install llama-index-llms-replicate pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface ``` Examples are in the `docs/examples` folder. Indices are in the `indices` folder (see list of indices below). To build a simple vector store index using OpenAI: ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"" from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(""YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY"").load_data() index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents) ``` To build a simple vector store index using non-OpenAI LLMs, e.g. Llama 2 hosted on [Replicate]( where you can easily create a free trial API token: ```python import os os.environ[""REPLICATE_API_TOKEN""] = ""YOUR_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"" from llama_index.core import Settings, VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding from llama_index.llms.replicate import Replicate from transformers import AutoTokenizer # set the LLM llama2_7b_chat = ""meta/llama-2-7b-chat:8e6975e5ed6174911a6ff3d60540dfd4844201974602551e10e9e87ab143d81e"" Settings.llm = Replicate( model=llama2_7b_chat, temperature=0.01, additional_kwargs={""top_p"": 1, ""max_new_tokens"": 300}, ) # set tokenizer to match LLM Settings.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained( ""NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"" ) # set the embed model Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding( model_name=""BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"" ) documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(""YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY"").load_data() index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents( documents, ) ``` To query: ```python query_engine = index.as_query_engine() query_engine.query(""YOUR_QUESTION"") ``` By default, data is stored in-memory. To persist to disk (under `./storage`): ```python index.storage_context.persist() ``` To reload from disk: ```python from llama_index.core import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage # rebuild storage context storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir=""./storage"") # load index index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context) ``` ## Dependencies We use poetry as the package manager for all Python packages. As a result, the dependencies of each Python package can be found by referencing the `pyproject.toml` file in each of the package's folders. ```bash cd pip install poetry poetry install --with dev ``` ## Citation Reference to cite if you use LlamaIndex in a paper: ``` @software{Liu_LlamaIndex_2022, author = {Liu, Jerry}, doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1234}, month = {11}, title = {{LlamaIndex}}, url = { year = {2022} } ```","4.4k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, question, triage, bug, enhancement, stale, P1, size:L, p2, documentation, size:M, size:S, P0, v0.10.X, lgtm, size:XXL, size:XL, discord, vector store, ollama, weaviate, storage, size:XS, request contribution board, reader, huggingface, evaluation, bedrock, azure, wontfix, safety"

cleanrl,vwxyzjn/cleanrl,4608,"['Python', 'Shell', 'HCL']","['wandb', 'reinforcement-learning', 'pytorch', 'python', 'gym']","# CleanRL (Clean Implementation of RL Algorithms) []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( CleanRL is a Deep Reinforcement Learning library that provides high-quality single-file implementation with research-friendly features. The implementation is clean and simple, yet we can scale it to run thousands of experiments using AWS Batch. The highlight features of CleanRL are: * Single-file implementation * *Every detail about an algorithm variant is put into a single standalone file.* * For example, our `ppo_atari.py` only has 340 lines of code but contains all implementation details on how PPO works with Atari games, **so it is a great reference implementation to read for folks who do not wish to read an entire modular library**. * Benchmarked Implementation (7+ algorithms and 34+ games at * Tensorboard Logging * Local Reproducibility via Seeding * Videos of Gameplay Capturing * Experiment Management with [Weights and Biases]( * Cloud Integration with docker and AWS You can read more about CleanRL in our [JMLR paper]( and [documentation]( CleanRL only contains implementations of **online** deep reinforcement learning algorithms. If you are looking for **offline** algorithms, please check out [corl-team/CORL]( which shares a similar design philosophy as CleanRL. > **Support for Gymnasium**: [Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium]( is the next generation of [`openai/gym`]( that will continue to be maintained and introduce new features. Please see their [announcement]( for further detail. We are migrating to `gymnasium` and the progress can be tracked in [vwxyzjn/cleanrl#277]( > **NOTE**: CleanRL is *not* a modular library and therefore it is not meant to be imported. At the cost of duplicate code, we make all implementation details of a DRL algorithm variant easy to understand, so CleanRL comes with its own pros and cons. You should consider using CleanRL if you want to 1) understand all implementation details of an algorithm's varaint or 2) prototype advanced features that other modular DRL libraries do not support (CleanRL has minimal lines of code so it gives you great debugging experience and you don't have do a lot of subclassing like sometimes in modular DRL libraries). ## Get started Prerequisites: * Python >=3.7.1,<3.11 * [Poetry 1.2.1+]( To run experiments locally, give the following a try: ```bash git clone && cd cleanrl poetry install # alternatively, you could use `poetry shell` and do # `python run cleanrl/ppo.py` poetry run python cleanrl/ppo.py \ --seed 1 \ --env-id CartPole-v0 \ --total-timesteps 50000 # open another terminal and enter `cd cleanrl/cleanrl` tensorboard --logdir runs ``` To use experiment tracking with wandb, run ```bash wandb login # only required for the first time poetry run python cleanrl/ppo.py \ --seed 1 \ --env-id CartPole-v0 \ --total-timesteps 50000 \ --track \ --wandb-project-name cleanrltest ``` If you are not using `poetry`, you can install CleanRL with `requirements.txt`: ```bash # core dependencies pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt # optional dependencies pip install -r requirements/requirements-atari.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-mujoco.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-mujoco_py.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-procgen.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-envpool.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-pettingzoo.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-jax.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-docs.txt pip install -r requirements/requirements-cloud.txt ``` To run training scripts in other games: ``` poetry shell # classic control python cleanrl/dqn.py --env-id CartPole-v1 python cleanrl/ppo.py --env-id CartPole-v1 python cleanrl/c51.py --env-id CartPole-v1 # atari poetry install -E atari python cleanrl/dqn_atari.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 python cleanrl/c51_atari.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 python cleanrl/ppo_atari.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 python cleanrl/sac_atari.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 # NEW: 3-4x side-effects free speed up with envpool's atari (only available to linux) poetry install -E envpool python cleanrl/ppo_atari_envpool.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 # Learn Pong-v5 in ~5-10 mins # Side effects such as lower sample efficiency might occur poetry run python ppo_atari_envpool.py --clip-coef=0.2 --num-envs=16 --num-minibatches=8 --num-steps=128 --update-epochs=3 # procgen poetry install -E procgen python cleanrl/ppo_procgen.py --env-id starpilot python cleanrl/ppg_procgen.py --env-id starpilot # ppo + lstm poetry install -E atari python cleanrl/ppo_atari_lstm.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 ``` You may also use a prebuilt development environment hosted in Gitpod: []( ## Algorithms Implemented | Algorithm | Variants Implemented | | ----------- | ----------- | | [Proximal Policy Gradient (PPO)]( | [`ppo.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`ppo_atari.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_continuous_action.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_atari_lstm.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_atari_envpool.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_atari_envpool_xla_jax.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_atari_envpool_xla_jax_scan.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_procgen.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_atari_multigpu.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_pettingzoo_ma_atari.py`]( [docs]( | | [`ppo_continuous_action_isaacgym.py`]( [docs]( | [Deep Q-Learning (DQN)]( | [`dqn.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`dqn_atari.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`dqn_jax.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`dqn_atari_jax.py`]( [docs]( | | [Categorical DQN (C51)]( | [`c51.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`c51_atari.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`c51_jax.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`c51_atari_jax.py`]( [docs]( | | [Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)]( | [`sac_continuous_action.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`sac_atari.py`]( [docs]( | | [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)]( | [`ddpg_continuous_action.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`ddpg_continuous_action_jax.py`]( [docs]( | [Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)]( | [`td3_continuous_action.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`td3_continuous_action_jax.py`]( [docs]( | | [Phasic Policy Gradient (PPG)]( | [`ppg_procgen.py`]( [docs]( | | [Random Network Distillation (RND)]( | [`ppo_rnd_envpool.py`]( [docs](/rl-algorithms/ppo-rnd/#ppo_rnd_envpoolpy) | | [Qdagger]( | [`qdagger_dqn_atari_impalacnn.py`]( [docs]( | | | [`qdagger_dqn_atari_jax_impalacnn.py`]( [docs]( | ## Open RL Benchmark To make our experimental data transparent, CleanRL participates in a related project called [Open RL Benchmark]( which contains tracked experiments from popular DRL libraries such as ours, [Stable-baselines3]( [openai/baselines]( [jaxrl]( and others.

Prisma Client Python is a next-generation ORM built on top of [Prisma]( that has been designed from the ground up for ease of use and correctness. [Prisma]( is a TypeScript ORM with zero-cost type safety for your database, although don't worry, Prisma Client Python [interfaces](#how-does-prisma-python-interface-with-prisma) with Prisma using Rust, you don't need Node or TypeScript. Prisma Client Python can be used in _any_ Python backend application. This can be a REST API, a GraphQL API or _anything_ else that needs a database. > _Note that the only language server that is known to support this form of autocompletion is Pylance / Pyright._ ## Why should you use Prisma Client Python? Unlike other Python ORMs, Prisma Client Python is **fully type safe** and offers native support for usage **with and without** `async`. All you have to do is [specify the type of client]( you would like to use for your project in the [Prisma schema file](#the-prisma-schema). However, the arguably best feature that Prisma Client Python provides is [autocompletion support](#auto-completion-for-query-arguments) (see the GIF above). This makes writing database queries easier than ever! Core features: - [Prisma Migrate]( - [Full type safety]( - [With / without async]( - [Recursive and pseudo-recursive types]( - [Atomic updates]( - [Complex cross-relational queries]( - [Partial type generation]( - [Batching write queries]( Supported database providers: - PostgreSQL - MySQL - SQLite - CockroachDB - MongoDB (experimental) - SQL Server (experimental) ## Support Have any questions or need help using Prisma?

This section provides a high-level overview of how Prisma works and its most important technical components. For a more thorough introduction, visit the [documentation]( ### The Prisma schema Every project that uses a tool from the Prisma toolkit starts with a [Prisma schema file]( The Prisma schema allows developers to define their _application models_ in an intuitive data modeling language. It also contains the connection to a database and defines a _generator_: ```prisma // database datasource db { provider = ""sqlite"" url = ""file:database.db"" } // generator generator client { provider = ""prisma-client-py"" recursive_type_depth = 5 } // data models model Post { id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) title String content String? views Int @default(0) published Boolean @default(false) author User? @relation(fields: [author_id], references: [id]) author_id Int? } model User { id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) email String @unique name String? posts Post[] } ``` In this schema, you configure three things: - **Data source**: Specifies your database connection. In this case we use a local SQLite database however you can also use an environment variable. - **Generator**: Indicates that you want to generate Prisma Client Python. - **Data models**: Defines your application models. --- On this page, the focus is on the generator as this is the only part of the schema that is specific to Prisma Client Python. You can learn more about [Data sources]( and [Data models]( on their respective documentation pages. ### Prisma generator A prisma schema can define one or more generators, defined by the `generator` block. A generator determines what assets are created when you run the `prisma generate` command. The `provider` value defines which Prisma Client will be created. In this case, as we want to generate Prisma Client Python, we use the `prisma-client-py` value. You can also define where the client will be generated to with the `output` option. By default Prisma Client Python will be generated to the same location it was installed to, whether that's inside a virtual environment, the global python installation or anywhere else that python packages can be imported from. For more options see [configuring Prisma Client Python]( --- ### Accessing your database with Prisma Client Python Just want to play around with Prisma Client Python and not worry about any setup? You can try it out online on [gitpod]( #### Installing Prisma Client Python The first step with any python project should be to setup a virtual environment to isolate installed packages from your other python projects, however that is out of the scope for this page. In this example we'll use an asynchronous client, if you would like to use a synchronous client see [setting up a synchronous client]( ```sh pip install -U prisma ``` #### Generating Prisma Client Python Now that we have Prisma Client Python installed we need to actually generate the client to be able to access the database. Copy the Prisma schema file shown above to a `schema.prisma` file in the root directory of your project and run: ```sh prisma db push ``` This command will add the data models to your database and generate the client, you should see something like this: ``` Prisma schema loaded from schema.prisma Datasource ""db"": SQLite database ""database.db"" at ""file:database.db"" SQLite database database.db created at file:database.db Your database is now in sync with your schema. Done in 26ms Generated Prisma Client Python to ./.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/prisma in 265ms ``` It should be noted that whenever you make changes to your `schema.prisma` file you will have to re-generate the client, you can do this automatically by running `prisma generate --watch`. The simplest asynchronous Prisma Client Python application will either look something like this: ```py import asyncio from prisma import Prisma async def main() -> None: prisma = Prisma() await prisma.connect() # write your queries here user = await prisma.user.create( data={ 'name': 'Robert', 'email': 'robert@craigie.dev' }, ) await prisma.disconnect() if __name__ == '__main__': asyncio.run(main()) ``` or like this: ```py import asyncio from prisma import Prisma from prisma.models import User async def main() -> None: db = Prisma(auto_register=True) await db.connect() # write your queries here user = await User.prisma().create( data={ 'name': 'Robert', 'email': 'robert@craigie.dev' }, ) await db.disconnect() if __name__ == '__main__': asyncio.run(main()) ``` #### Query examples For a more complete list of queries you can perform with Prisma Client Python see the [documentation]( All query methods return [pydantic models]( **Retrieve all `User` records from the database** ```py users = await db.user.find_many() ``` **Include the `posts` relation on each returned `User` object** ```py users = await db.user.find_many( include={ 'posts': True, }, ) ``` **Retrieve all `Post` records that contain `""prisma""`** ```py posts = await db.post.find_many( where={ 'OR': [ {'title': {'contains': 'prisma'}}, {'content': {'contains': 'prisma'}}, ] } ) ``` **Create a new `User` and a new `Post` record in the same query** ```py user = await db.user.create( data={ 'name': 'Robert', 'email': 'robert@craigie.dev', 'posts': { 'create': { 'title': 'My first post from Prisma!', }, }, }, ) ``` **Update an existing `Post` record** ```py post = await db.post.update( where={ 'id': 42, }, data={ 'views': { 'increment': 1, }, }, ) ``` #### Usage with static type checkers All Prisma Client Python methods are fully statically typed, this means you can easily catch bugs in your code without having to run it! For more details see the [documentation]( #### How does Prisma Client Python interface with Prisma? Prisma Client Python connects to the database and executes queries using Prisma's rust-based Query Engine, of which the source code can be found here: Prisma Client Python exposes a CLI interface which wraps the [Prisma CLI]( This works by downloading a Node binary, if you don't already have Node installed on your machine, installing the CLI with `npm` and running the CLI using Node. The CLI interface is the exact same as the standard [Prisma CLI]( with [some additional commands]( ## Affiliation Prisma Client Python is _not_ an official Prisma product although it is very generously sponsored by Prisma. ## Room for improvement Prisma Client Python is a fairly new project and as such there are some features that are missing or incomplete. ### Auto completion for query arguments Prisma Client Python query arguments make use of `TypedDict` types. Support for completion of these types within the Python ecosystem is now fairly widespread. This section is only here for documenting support. Supported editors / extensions: - VSCode with [pylance]( v2021.9.4 or higher - Sublime Text with [LSP-Pyright]( v1.1.196 or higher - PyCharm [2022.1 EAP 3]() added support for completing `TypedDict`s - This does not yet work for Prisma Client Python unfortunately, see [this issue]( - Any editor that supports the Language Server Protocol and has an extension supporting Pyright v1.1.196 or higher - vim and neovim with [coc.nvim]( - [emacs]( ```py user = await db.user.find_first( where={ '|' } ) ``` Given the cursor is where the `|` is, an IDE should suggest the following completions: - id - email - name - posts ### Performance While there has currently not been any work done on improving the performance of Prisma Client Python queries, they should be reasonably fast as the core query building and connection handling is performed by Prisma. Performance is something that will be worked on in the future and there is room for massive improvements. ### Supported platforms Windows, MacOS and Linux are all officially supported. ## Version guarantees Prisma Client Python is _not_ stable. Breaking changes will be documented and released under a new **MINOR** version following this format. `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH` New releases are scheduled bi-weekly, however as this is a solo project, no guarantees are made that this schedule will be stuck to. ## Contrib...

icheck,drgullin/icheck,7391,"['CSS', 'HTML', 'JavaScript']",[],"# [iCheck plugin]( [1.0.3](#october-10-2020) #### Highly customizable checkboxes and radio buttons for jQuery and Zepto. Refer to the [iCheck website]( for examples. **Note: [iCheck v2.0]( is on the way**, it got a huge performance boost, many new options and methods. It's in a release candidate state, so you may try to use it. Feel free to submit an issue if you find something not working. Features -------- * **Identical inputs across different browsers and devices** both [desktop and mobile](#browser-support) * **Touch devices support** iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Amazon Kindle * **Keyboard accessible inputs** `Tab`, `Spacebar`, `Arrow up/down` and other shortcuts * **Customization freedom** use any HTML and CSS to style inputs (try [6 Retina-ready skins]( * **jQuery and Zepto** JavaScript libraries support from single file * **Screenreader accessible inputs** [ARIA]( attributes for VoiceOver and others * **Lightweight size** 1 kb gzipped ----- * [32 options](#options) to customize checkboxes and radio buttons * [11 callbacks](#callbacks) to handle changes * [9 methods](#methods) to make changes programmatically * Saves changes to original inputs, [works carefully](#initialize) with any selectors How it works ------------ iCheck works with checkboxes and radio buttons like a constructor. **It wraps each input with a div**, which may be customized by you or using one of the [available skins]( You may also place inside that div some HTML code or text using `insert` option. For this HTML: ```html Foo Bar Bar ``` With default options you'll get nearly this: ```html Foo Bar Bar ``` **By default, iCheck doesn't provide any CSS styles for wrapper divs** (if you don't use [skins]( Options ------- These options are default: ```js { // 'checkbox' or 'radio' to style only checkboxes or radio buttons, both by default handle: '', // base class added to customized checkboxes checkboxClass: 'icheckbox', // base class added to customized radio buttons radioClass: 'iradio', // class added on checked state (input.checked = true) checkedClass: 'checked', // if not empty, used instead of 'checkedClass' option (input type specific) checkedCheckboxClass: '', checkedRadioClass: '', // if not empty, added as class name on unchecked state (input.checked = false) uncheckedClass: '', // if not empty, used instead of 'uncheckedClass' option (input type specific) uncheckedCheckboxClass: '', uncheckedRadioClass: '', // class added on disabled state (input.disabled = true) disabledClass: 'disabled', // if not empty, used instead of 'disabledClass' option (input type specific) disabledCheckboxClass: '', disabledRadioClass: '', // if not empty, added as class name on enabled state (input.disabled = false) enabledClass: '', // if not empty, used instead of 'enabledClass' option (input type specific) enabledCheckboxClass: '', enabledRadioClass: '', // class added on indeterminate state (input.indeterminate = true) indeterminateClass: 'indeterminate', // if not empty, used instead of 'indeterminateClass' option (input type specific) indeterminateCheckboxClass: '', indeterminateRadioClass: '', // if not empty, added as class name on determinate state (input.indeterminate = false) determinateClass: '', // if not empty, used instead of 'determinateClass' option (input type specific) determinateCheckboxClass: '', determinateRadioClass: '', // class added on hover state (pointer is moved onto input) hoverClass: 'hover', // class added on focus state (input has gained focus) focusClass: 'focus', // class added on active state (mouse button is pressed on input) activeClass: 'active', // adds hoverClass to customized input on label hover and labelHoverClass to label on input hover labelHover: true, // class added to label if labelHover set to true labelHoverClass: 'hover', // increase clickable area by given % (negative number to decrease) increaseArea: '', // true to set 'pointer' CSS cursor over enabled inputs and 'default' over disabled cursor: false, // set true to inherit original input's class name inheritClass: false, // if set to true, input's id is prefixed with 'iCheck-' and attached inheritID: false, // set true to activate ARIA support aria: false, // add HTML code or text inside customized input insert: '' } ``` There's no need to copy and paste all of them, you can just mention the ones you need: ```js $('input').iCheck({ labelHover: false, cursor: true }); ``` You can choose any class names and style them as you want. Initialize ---------- Just include `icheck.js` after [jQuery v1.7+]( (or [Zepto]( [polyfill, event, data]). iCheck supports any selectors, but handles only checkboxes and radio buttons: ```js // customize all inputs (will search for checkboxes and radio buttons) $('input').iCheck(); // handle inputs only inside $('.block') $('.block input').iCheck(); // handle only checkboxes inside $('.test') $('.test input').iCheck({ handle: 'checkbox' }); // handle .vote class elements (will search inside the element, if it's not an input) $('.vote').iCheck(); // you can also change options after inputs are customized $('input.some').iCheck({ // different options }); ``` Indeterminate --------- HTML5 allows specifying [indeterminate]( (""partially"" checked) state for checkboxes. iCheck supports this for both checkboxes and radio buttons. You can make an input indeterminate through HTML using additional attributes (supported by iCheck). Both do the same job, but `indeterminate=""true""` may not work in some browsers (like IE7): ```html indeterminate=""true"" determinate=""false"" ``` `indeterminate` and `determinate` [methods](#methods) can be used to toggle indeterminate state. Callbacks --------- iCheck provides plenty callbacks, which may be used to handle changes. Callback name When used ifClicked user clicked on a customized input or an assigned label ifChanged input's ""checked"", ""disabled"" or ""indeterminate"" state is changed ifChecked input's state is changed to ""checked"" ifUnchecked ""checked"" state is removed ifToggled input's ""checked"" state is changed ifDisabled input's state is changed to ""disabled"" ifEnabled ""disabled"" state is removed ifIndeterminate input's state is changed to ""indeterminate"" ifDeterminate ""indeterminate"" state is removed ifCreated input is just customized ifDestroyed customization is just removed Use `on()` method to bind them to inputs: ```js $('input').on('ifChecked', function(event){ alert(event.type + ' callback'); }); ``` `ifCreated` callback should be binded before plugin init. Methods ------- These methods can be used to make changes programmatically (any selectors can be used): ```js // change input's state to 'checked' $('input').iCheck('check'); // remove 'checked' state $('input').iCheck('uncheck'); // toggle 'checked' state $('input').iCheck('toggle'); // change input's state to 'disabled' $('input').iCheck('disable'); // remove 'disabled' state $('input').iCheck('enable'); // change input's state to 'indeterminate' $('input').iCheck('indeterminate'); // remove 'indeterminate' state $('input').iCheck('determinate'); // apply input changes, which were done outside the plugin $('input').iCheck('update'); // remove all traces of iCheck $('input').iCheck('destroy'); ``` You may also specify some function, that will be executed on each method call: ```js $('input').iCheck('check', function(){ alert('Well done, Sir'); }); ``` Feel free to fork and submit pull-request or submit an issue if you find something not working. Comparison ---------- iCheck is created to avoid routine of reinventing the wheel when working with checkboxes and radio buttons. It provides an expected identical result for the huge number of browsers, devices and their versions. Callbacks and methods can be used to easily handle and make changes at customized inputs. There are some CSS3 ways available to style checkboxes and radio buttons, like [this one]( You have to know about some of the disadvantages of similar methods: * inputs are keyboard inaccessible, since `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` used to hide them * poor browser support * multiple bugs on mobile devices * tricky, harder to maintain CSS code * JavaScript is still needed to fix specific issues While CSS3 method is quite limited solution, iCheck is made to be an everyday replacement covering most of the tasks. Browser support --------------- iCheck is verified to work in Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2+, Opera 9+, Google Chrome and Safari browsers. Should also work in many others. Mobile browsers (like Opera mini, Chrome mobile, Safari mobile, Android browser, Silk and others) are also supported. Tested on iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod), Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone devices. Changelog --------------- ## October 10, 2020 * iOS 13 support @markusbroman * Reformatted changelog @lasseeee * Fire change event when toggled @rafatmyo ### March 03, 2014 * Better HiDPI screens support @ddctd143 ### January 23, 2014 ([v2.0 release candidate]( * Three ways to set an options: global object (`window.icheck`), data attributes (`<input data-checkedClass=""checked""`) and direct JavaScript object (`$(input).icheck({ options })`) * Huge performance boost (takes less than 1s to customize 1000 inputs) * Minimized number of function calls (some slow jQuery functions are replaced with a faster vanilla alternatives without using any dependencies) * AMD module definition support (both for jQuery and Zepto) * Unblocked native events - iCheck 2.x doesn't stop your newly or past binded events from being processed * Pointer events support - full support for phones and tablets that use Windows OS (such as Lumia, HP tablets, desktops with a touch screen, etc) * WebOS and Firefox OS support * New methods: `$(input).icheck('data')` to get all the options were used for customization (also stores a current states values - `checked`, `disabled` and `indeterminate`), `$('input').icheck('styler')` to get a wrapper div (that's used for customization) * Better handling of the `indeterminate` state * Ability to set callbacks in three ways: global object, direct JavaScript object or using bind method (`$(input).on(callback)`) * Ability to switch off some of the callbacks when you don't need them (global or per input) * Inline styles dropped - iCheck won't add any inline styles to the elements until it's highly needed (`cursor` or `area` option) * Fast click support - removes a 300ms click delay on mobile devices without any dependencies (iCheck compatible with the `fastclick` plugin), see the `tap` option * Ability to ignore customization for the selected inputs using `init` option (if set to `false`) * Optimized event bindings - iCheck binds only a few global events for the all inputs (doesn't increase on elements addition), instead of a couple for the each customized element * Doesn't store tons of arbitrary data (event in jQuery or Zepto cache), defines customized elements by specific classnames * Extra `ins` tag is dropped (less DOM modifications), iCheck wraps each input with a single `div` and doesn't use any extra markup for the any option * Optimized reflows and repaints on init and state changes * Better options handling - iCheck will never run a single line of JS to process an options that are off or empty * Ability to auto customize the ajax loaded inputs without using any extra code (`autoAjax` option, on by default) * Auto inits on domready using the specified selector (`autoInit` option) - searches for `.icheck` by default. Classnames can be changed using the `window.classes` object * Memory usage optimization - uses only a few amount of memory (works well on low-memory devices) * Betters callbacks architecture - these are fired only after changes are applied to the input * Ability to set a mirror classes between the inputs and assigned labels using the `hoverLabelClass`, `focusLabelClass`, `activeLabelClass`, `checkedLabelClass`, `disabledLabelClass` and `indeterminateLabelClass` options (`mirror` option should be set to `true` to make this happen) * Fixes some issues of the mobile devices * Fixes the issues of the wrapper labels, that loose a click ability in some browsers (if no `for` attribute is set) * Some other options and improvements * Various bug fixes Note: extended docs and usage examples will be available later. ### December 19, 2013 * Added Bower support * Added to jQuery plugin registry ### December 18, 2013 * Added ARIA attributes support (for VoiceOver and others) @myfreeweb * Added Amazon Kindle support @skinofstars * Fixed clickable links inside labels @LeGaS * Fixed lines separation between labels and inputs * Merged two versions of the plugin (jQuery and Zepto) into one * Fixed demo links * Fixed callbacks @PepijnSenders License ------- iCheck plugin is released under the [MIT License]( Feel free to use it in personal and commercial projects.","1.6k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Security, Insights, enhancements, questions, features, bugs, skins, incorrect"

spring-petclinic,spring-projects/spring-petclinic,7303,"['CSS', 'Java', 'HTML']",[],"# Spring PetClinic Sample Application []( []( []( ## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams [See the presentation here]( ## Run Petclinic locally Spring Petclinic is a [Spring Boot]( application built using [Maven]( or [Gradle]( You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer): ```bash git clone cd spring-petclinic ./mvnw package java -jar target/*.jar ``` You can then access the Petclinic at . Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this, it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this): ```bash ./mvnw spring-boot:run ``` > NOTE: If you prefer to use Gradle, you can build the app using `./gradlew build` and look for the jar file in `build/libs`. ## Building a Container There is no `Dockerfile` in this project. You can build a container image (if you have a docker daemon) using the Spring Boot build plugin: ```bash ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image ``` ## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic Our issue tracker is available [here]( ## Database configuration In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is exposed at ` and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:` URL. The UUID is printed at startup to the console. A similar setup is provided for MySQL and PostgreSQL if a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type changes, the app needs to run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySQL or `spring.profiles.active=postgres` for PostgreSQL. You can start MySQL or PostgreSQL locally with whatever installer works for your OS or use docker: ```bash docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.4 ``` or ```bash docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=petclinic -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=petclinic -e POSTGRES_DB=petclinic -p 5432:5432 postgres:16.3 ``` Further documentation is provided for [MySQL]( and [PostgreSQL]( Instead of vanilla `docker` you can also use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start the database containers. Each one has a profile just like the Spring profile: ```bash docker-compose --profile mysql up ``` or ```bash docker-compose --profile postgres up ``` ## Test Applications At development time we recommend you use the test applications set up as `main()` methods in `PetClinicIntegrationTests` (using the default H2 database and also adding Spring Boot Devtools), `MySqlTestApplication` and `PostgresIntegrationTests`. These are set up so that you can run the apps in your IDE to get fast feedback and also run the same classes as integration tests against the respective database. The MySql integration tests use Testcontainers to start the database in a Docker container, and the Postgres tests use Docker Compose to do the same thing. ## Compiling the CSS There is a `petclinic.css` in `src/main/resources/static/resources/css`. It was generated from the `petclinic.scss` source, combined with the [Bootstrap]( library. If you make changes to the `scss`, or upgrade Bootstrap, you will need to re-compile the CSS resources using the Maven profile ""css"", i.e. `./mvnw package -P css`. There is no build profile for Gradle to compile the CSS. ## Working with Petclinic in your IDE ### Prerequisites The following items should be installed in your system: - Java 17 or newer (full JDK, not a JRE) - [Git command line tool]( - Your preferred IDE - Eclipse with the m2e plugin. Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in `Help -> About` dialog. If m2e is not there, follow the install process [here]( - [Spring Tools Suite]( (STS) - [IntelliJ IDEA]( - [VS Code]( ### Steps 1. On the command line run: ```bash git clone ``` 1. Inside Eclipse or STS: Open the project via `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project`, then select the root directory of the cloned repo. Then either build on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or use the Eclipse launcher (right-click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the CSS. Run the application's main method by right-clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`. 1. Inside IntelliJ IDEA: In the main menu, choose`File -> Open` and select thePetclinic [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button. - CSS files are generated from the Maven build. You can build them on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or right-click on the `spring-petclinic` project then `Maven -> Generates sources and Update Folders`. - A run configuration named `PetClinicApplication` should have been created for you if you're using a recent Ultimate version. Otherwise, run the application by right-clicking on the `PetClinicApplication` main class and choosing `Run 'PetClinicApplication'`. 1. Navigate to the Petclinic Visit [ in your browser. ## Looking for something in particular? |Spring Boot Configuration | Class or Java property files | |--------------------------|---| |The Main Class | [PetClinicApplication]( | |Properties Files | [application.properties]( | |Caching | [CacheConfiguration]( | ## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks The Spring Petclinic ""main"" branch in the [spring-projects]( GitHub org is the ""canonical"" implementation based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are [quite a few forks]( in the GitHub org [spring-petclinic]( If you are interested in using a different technology stack to implement the Pet Clinic, please join the community there. ## Interaction with other open-source projects One of the best parts about working on the Spring Petclinic application is that we have the opportunity to work in direct contact with many Open Source projects. We found bugs/suggested improvements on various topics such as Spring, Spring Data, Bean Validation and even Eclipse! In many cases, they've been fixed/implemented in just a few days. Here is a list of them: | Name | Issue | |------|-------| | Spring JDBC: simplify usage of NamedParameterJdbcTemplate | [SPR-10256]( and [SPR-10257]( | | Bean Validation / Hibernate Validator: simplify Maven dependencies and backward compatibility |[HV-790]( and [HV-792]( | | Spring Data: provide more flexibility when working with JPQL queries | [DATAJPA-292]( | ## Contributing The [issue tracker]( is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests and submitting pull requests.

DataTables,DataTables/DataTables,7284,"['CSS', 'JavaScript']",[],"# Legacy repository Please note that this is a **legacy repo** for DataTables. The main source repo [is DataTables/DataTablesSrc]( Our distribution repos (for NPM, Nuget, etc packages) are the `DataTables/Dist-*` repos - e.g. [DataTables/Dist-DataTables]( Each distribution repo has a core Javascript file or styling for DataTables or an extension. Please use our [download builder]( to obtain the files you need, including for NPM, Nuget, CDN and download. # DataTables plug-in for jQuery DataTables is a table enhancing plug-in for the [jQuery](//jquery.com) Javascript library, adding sorting, paging and filtering abilities to plain HTML tables with minimal effort. The stated goal of DataTables is: > To enhance the accessibility of data in HTML tables. To meet this goal, DataTables is developed with two distinct groups of users in mind: * You the developers using DataTables. For developers DataTables provides a wide array of options for how data should be obtained, displayed and acted upon, along with an extensive API for accessing and manipulating the table. * End users. For those using the interface DataTables presents, actions to get the most from the information contained in tables, such as sorting and filtering, along with paging and scrolling of the data in table, are easy to use, intuitive and fast. ## Installing DataTables To use DataTables, the primary way to obtain the software is to use the [DataTables downloader](//datatables.net/download). You can also include the individual files from the [DataTables CDN](//cdn.datatables.net). See the [documentation](//datatables.net/manual/installation) for full details. ### NPM and Bower If you prefer to use a package manager such as NPM or Bower, distribution repositories are available with software built from this repository under the name `datatables.net`. Styling packages for Bootstrap, Foundation and other styling libraries are also available by adding a suffix to the package name. Please see the DataTables [NPM](//datatables.net/download/npm) and [Bower](//datatables.net/download/bower) installation pages for further information. The [DataTables installation manual](//datatables.net/manual/installation) also has details on how to use package managers with DataTables. ## Usage In its simplest case, DataTables can be initialised with a single line of Javascript: ```js $('table').dataTable(); ``` where the jQuery selector is used to obtain a reference to the table you want to enhance with DataTables. Optional configuration parameters can be passed in to DataTables to have it perform certain actions by using a configuration object as the parameter passed in to the DataTables constructor. For example: ```js $('table').dataTable( { paginate: false, scrollY: 300 } ); ``` will disable paging and enable scrolling. A full list of the options available for DataTables are available in the [documentation](//datatables.net). ## Documentation Full documentation of the DataTables options, API and plug-in interface are available on the [DataTables web-site](//datatables.net). The site also contains information on the wide variety of plug-ins that are available for DataTables, which can be used to enhance and customise your table even further. ## Support Support for DataTables is available through the [DataTables forums](//datatables.net/forums) and [commercial support options](//datatables.net/support) are available. ## License DataTables is release under the [MIT license](//datatables.net/license).

css-loaders,lukehaas/css-loaders,7041,"['CSS', 'Less', 'SCSS']",[],"# [Single Element CSS Spinners]( This is a collection of loading spinners animated with CSS. Each spinner consists of a single `div` with a class of `loader` and content text of ""Loading..."". The text is for screen readers and can be used as a fallback state for older browsers. The aim of this project was to create a set of minimal loading spinners that are visually appealing and also convey their intended meaning. A strict limit of one element per loader (not including pseudo-elements) was placed on this project based on the belief that something as simple as a loader doesn't deserve more. Each loader is given a font size in pixels and all other sizes are in ems so to change the size of a loader, just adjust the font-size. ## Demo []( > [Check it live]( ## Browser Support | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | IE 10+ | Chrome 4.0+ | Firefox 16.0+ | Opera 15.0+ | Safari 4.0+ | ## Contributing 1.

Get started at [ ## Basic Usage Place the 5 font files and the main `weather-icons.min.css` file in your project, with the assumption that the fonts are located up `../` from your CSS directory. The icons are displayed by using an `i` element and adding the base class `wi` and then the icon class you want, such as `day-sunny`. This then looks like ``. To add a modifier, include the class you want after the icon name, which looks like ``. You can flip, rotate, or add a fixed width. See it all at [ ## API Usage This set includes companion CSS files for popular weather service API. Presently there are mappings for Forecast.io, Open Weather Map, World Meteorological Organization, Weather Underground, and Yahoo. Check the [API List]( to see the class names. ## Wind Usage To use the wind indicators, you must also use `weather-icons-wind.min.css` along with the default CSS file. To display a wind indicator, you must use the base class `wi` and `wi-wind`, and then include the towards/from direction you want, like `from-293-deg`. This ends up looking like . You can use any degree from 0 to 359 in this manner. **Note:** A ""from"" class has the point of the arrow at the opposite end of the degree. For example, a ""from 90 degrees"" icon would point to the 270 degree mark, wheras a ""towards 270 degrees"" would point at the same 270 degree mark. Included in the set as well are aliases to point to cardinal directions. They work the same as degrees, for example `` would be an arrow pointing to the South by Southeast (roughly 158 degrees). ## Contributing If you feel so inclined to add icon ideas, icon art, or other fixes/changes to how the package works, feel free to help! ## Credit The icon designs are originally by [Lukas Bischoff]( Icon art for v1.1 forward, HTML, Less, and CSS are by [me (Erik)]( ## Licensing * Weather Icons licensed under [SIL OFL 1.1]( * Code licensed under [MIT License]( * Documentation licensed under [CC BY 3.0](","849, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, new icon, enhancement, question, bug, wontfix, invalid, duplicate"

Exposed,JetBrains/Exposed,7960,['Kotlin'],"['kotlin', 'sql', 'dao', 'orm']","[]( []( []( []( []( ## Welcome to **Exposed**, an ORM framework for [Kotlin]( Exposed is a lightweight SQL library on top of a JDBC driver for the Kotlin language. Exposed has two flavors of database access: typesafe SQL wrapping DSL and lightweight Data Access Objects (DAO). With Exposed, you have two options for database access: wrapping DSL and a lightweight DAO. Our official mascot is the cuttlefish, which is well-known for its outstanding mimicry ability that enables it to blend seamlessly into any environment. Similar to our mascot, Exposed can be used to mimic a variety of database engines, which helps you to build applications without dependencies on any specific database engine and to switch between them with very little or no changes. ## Supported Databases - H2 (versions 2.x; 1.x version is deprecated and will be removed in future releases) - []( - []( - []( - []( (Also, PostgreSQL using the [pgjdbc-ng]( JDBC driver) - []( - []( ## Dependencies ### Maven Central configuration Releases of Exposed are available in the Maven Central repository.

Translations Differences to NewPipe With NewPipe, the extraction is done locally on your phone, and all the requests sent towards YouTube/Google are done directly from the network you're connected to, which doesn't use a middleman server in between. Therefore, Google can still access information such as the user's IP address. Aside from that, subscriptions can only be stored locally. LibreTube takes this one step further and proxies all requests via Piped (which uses the NewPipeExtractor). This prevents Google servers from accessing your IP address or any other personal data. Apart from that, Piped allows syncing your subscriptions between LibreTube and Piped, which can be used on desktop too. If the NewPipeExtractor breaks, it only requires an update of Piped and not LibreTube itself. Therefore, fixes usually arrive faster than in NewPipe. While LibreTube only supports YouTube, NewPipe also allows the use of other platforms like SoundCloud, PeerTube, Bandcamp and media.ccc.de. Both are great clients for watching YouTube videos.

Unciv,yairm210/Unciv,7820,"['Kotlin', 'Dockerfile', 'Shell']","['civilization-v', 'android', 'libgdx', 'civilization', 'game']","# Unciv - Civ V remake for Android & Desktop []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( ## What is this? An open source, moddability-focused Android and Desktop remake of Civ V, made with LibGDX ## Is this any good? Depends what you're looking for. If you're in the market for high-res graphics, amazing soundtracks, animations etc, I highly recommend Firaxis's Civ-V-like game, ""Civilization V"". If you want a small, fast, moddable, FOSS, in-depth 4X that can still run on a potato, you've come to the right place :) ## What's the roadmap? In this order: * Polish! As you may have noticed, Unciv is fully functional but rough around the edges. This means: * UI+UX improvements ([suggestions welcome!]( * Better automation, AI etc. in-game * G&K mechanics - espionage, small other changes (see [#4697]( * BNW mechanics - trade routes, world congress, etc. ## Contributing Programmers start [here]( Translators start [here]( Modders start [here]( You can join us in any of the open issue, or work on improving anything you want - once you're finished, issue a pull request and it'll go into the next version! If not, you can help by spreading the word - vote for Unciv where you can, mention it on Reddit or Twitter etc, and help us with new ideas of how to get the word out! ## FAQ ## How do I install? - **Android** - [Google Play]( or [F-droid]( - **Windows/Linux** - [itch.io]( Flatpak via [Flathub]( or [AUR]( - **Raspberry Pi** - [Pi-apps]( - **MacOS** - Install [with this guide]( - Jars, APKs and Windows/Linux builds also available in [Releases]( (run jar with `java -jar Unciv.jar`) - *not recommended* since we update frequently and you will quickly become out-of-date - [Build from scratch]( if that's your thing ### How about IOS? I'm not planning on it. It means paying money to Apple, yet another release path, and since I don't have an IOS device it means I can't test it properly. ### Steam release? Steam has decided that they don't want to host Unciv, they probably don't want to risk legal issues with Firaxis (although those should be non-existent, see below) ### Will you implement {feature}? If it's in the original Civ V, then yes! If not, then the feature won't be added to the base game - possibly it will be added as a way to mod the game, which is constantly expanding #### Why not? This is its own game, why not add features that weren't in Civ V? Having a clear vision is important for actually getting things done. Anyone can make a suggestion. Not all are good, viable, or simple. Not many can actually implement stuff. As an open source project, this stuff is done in our spare time, of which there isn't much. We need a clear-cut criteria to decide what to work on and what not to work on. #### Will you implement Civ VI? Considering how long it took to get this far, no. ### How can I learn to play? Where's the wiki? All the tutorial information is available in-game at menu > civilopedia > tutorials All the information is included in the amazing [Civ V wiki]( Since this is a Civ V clone, you can search Google for how to play Civ V and there are loads of answers =) Alternatively, you could [join us on Discord]( and ask there =D ### Aren't you basically making a Civ V clone? Is that even legal? According to the [US Copyright Office FL-108]( intellectual property rights *do not* apply to mechanics - as I'm sure you know, there are a billion Flappy Bird knockoffs It is definitely illegal: - To use any assets from the original game (images, sound etc) - they belong to Firaxis It is probably illegal (no solid sources on this): - To use the Civilization name - To impersonate the Civ games (so calling yourself civi|zation with a similar logo, for instance) Interestingly, [Civilization is a registered trademark]( but it looks like it's only *that particular logo* which is trademarked, so technically you could make another game called ""Civilization"" and it'll stick. In any case we're not going there :) ## Run with Docker []( If you have docker compose installed: ```$ docker compose build && docker compose up``` and then goto If just docker: ```$ docker build . -t unciv && docker run -d -p 6901:6901 -p 5901:5901 unciv ``` Or just use our already built one: ```$ docker run -d -p 6901:6901 -p 5901:5901 ghcr.io/yairm210/unciv ``` and then goto ## [Credits and 3rd parties](docs/Credits.md)","1.5k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Security, Insights, bug, feature, Will not stale, AI, help wanted, Stale, Conflicts, enhancement, UI, Missing saved game, wontfix, Documentation, performance, not enough translations, mergeable translation, Toolchain, Solved, Contains Saved Game"

RIBs,uber/RIBs,7692,"['Kotlin', 'Java', 'Swift']","['ios', 'android', 'mobile', 'mobile-app', 'mobile-development']","[]( []( []( []( []( RIBs is the cross-platform architecture framework behind many mobile apps at Uber. The name RIBs is short for Router, Interactor and Builder, which are core components of this architecture. This framework is designed for mobile apps with a large number of engineers and nested states. The RIBs architecture provides: * **Shared architecture across iOS and Android.** Build cross-platform apps that have similar architecture, enabling iOS and Android teams to cross-review business logic code. * **Testability and Isolation.** Classes must be easy to unit test and reason about in isolation. Individual RIB classes have distinct responsibilities like: routing, business, view logic, creation. Plus, most RIB logic is decoupled from child RIB logic. This makes RIB classes easy to test and reason about independently. * **Tooling for developer productivity.** RIBs come with IDE tooling around code generation, memory leak detection, static analysis and runtime integrations - all which improve developer productivity for large teams or small. * **An architecture that scales.** This architecture has proven to scale to hundreds of engineers working on the same codebase and apps with hundreds of RIBs. ## Documentation To get started with RIBs, please refer to the [RIBs documentation]( This describes key concepts on RIBs, from what they are for, their structure and common use cases. To get more hands on with RIBs, we have written a [series of tutorials]( that run you through the main aspects of the architecture with hands-on examples. To read about the backstory on why we created RIBs, see [this blog post]( we wrote when releasing RIBs in production the first time and see [this short video]( where we discussed how the RIBs architecture works. #### What is the difference between RIBs and MV*/VIPER? MVC, MVP, MVI, MVVM and VIPER are architecture patterns. RIBs is a framework. What differentiates RIBs from frameworks based on MV*/VIPER is: - **Business logic drives the app, not the view tree**. Unlike with MV*/VIPER, a RIB does not have to have a view. This means that the app hierarchy is driven by the business logic, not the view tree. - **Independent business logic and view trees**. RIBs decouple how the business logic scopes are structured from view hierarchies. This allows the application to have a deep business logic tree, isolating business logic nodes, while maintaining a shallow view hierarchy making layouts, animations and transitions easy. There are some other novel things about RIBs. However, these could also be implemented with other MV*/VIPER frameworks. These are: - **Cross-platform approach**, allowing iOS and Android architecture to stay in sync. - **Tooling for easier adoption** on larger apps or teams. Tooling we are open sourcing includes IDE plugins for code generation and static code analysis. - **Strong opinions about how state should be communicated**, using DI and Rx. Each RIB defines its dependencies and what dependencies it needs from its parent. Parent components that fulfill a childs parent dependencies are provided to child Builders as a constructor dependency to allow for hierarchical DI scoping. This means that information is communicated via these dependencies up and down the tree. ## Usage 1. Clone this repository 2. Integrate using your preferred installation mechanism For usage of the tooling built around RIBs, please see the [Tooling section]( in our documentation. ## Installation for Android To integrate the recommended minimum setup for RIBs add the following to your `build.gradle`: ```gradle dependencies { annotationProcessor 'com.uber.rib:rib-compiler-test:0.16.2' implementation 'com.uber.rib:rib-android:0.16.2' testImplementation 'com.uber.rib:rib-test:0.16.2' } ``` There are a number of extension packages available as well including Kotlin extensions, Jetpack Compose support, Coroutines support ## Installation for iOS #### CocoaPods To integrate RIBs into your project add the following to your `Podfile`: ```ruby pod 'RIBs', '~> 0.9' ``` #### Carthage To integrate RIBs into your project using Carthage add the following to your `Cartfile`: ```ruby github ""uber/RIBs"" ~> 0.9 ``` ## Related projects If you like RIBs, check out other related open source projects from our team: - [Needle]( a compile-time safe Swift dependency injection framework. - [Motif]( An abstract on top of Dagger offering simpler APIs for nested scopes. - [Swift Concurrency]( a set of concurrency utility classes used by Uber, inspired by the equivalent [java.util.concurrent]( package classes. - [Swift Abstract Class]( a light-weight library along with an executable that enables compile-time safe abstract class development for Swift projects. - [Swift Common]( common libraries used by this set of Swift open source projects. ## License Copyright (C) 2017 Uber Technologies Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License""); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. - DataBinding: Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically. - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access. - [Hilt]( for dependency injection. - Architecture - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model) - [Bindables]( Android DataBinding kit for notifying data changes to UI layers. - Repository Pattern - [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3]( Construct the REST APIs and paging network data. - [Sandwich]( Construct a lightweight and modern response interface to handle network payload for Android. - [Moshi]( A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java. - [WhatIf]( Check nullable objects and empty collections more fluently. - [Bundler]( Android Intent & Bundle extensions, which insert and retrieve values elegantly. - [ksp]( Kotlin Symbol Processing API. - [Turbine]( A small testing library for kotlinx.coroutines Flow. - [Material-Components]( Material design components for building ripple animation, and CardView. - [Glide]( [GlidePalette]( Loading images from network. - [TransformationLayout]( Implementing transformation motion animations. - Custom Views - [Rainbow]( An easy way to apply gradations and tinting for Android. - [AndroidRibbon]( A simple way to implement a beautiful ribbon with the shimmering on Android. - [ProgressView]( A polished and flexible ProgressView, fully customizable with animations. - [Timber]( A logger with a small, extensible API. ## Architecture **Pokedex** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows the [Google's official architecture guidance]( The overall architecture of **Pokedex** is composed of two layers; the UI layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they have each different responsibilities, as defined below: **Pokedex** was built with [Guide to app architecture]( so it would be a great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects. ### Architecture Overview - Each layer follows [unidirectional event/data flow]( the UI layer emits user events to the data layer, and the data layer exposes data as a stream to other layers. - The data layer is designed to work independently from other layers and must be pure, which means it doesn't have any dependencies on the other layers. With this loosely coupled architecture, you can increase the reusability of components and scalability of your app. ### UI Layer The UI layer consists of UI elements to configure screens that could interact with users and [ViewModel]( that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes. - UI elements observe the data flow via [DataBinding]( which is the most essential part of the MVVM architecture. - With [Bindables]( which is an Android DataBinding kit for notifying data changes, you can implement two-way binding, and data observation in XML very clean. ### Data Layer The data Layer consists of repositories, which include business logic, such as querying data from the local database and requesting remote data from the network. It is implemented as an offline-first source of business logic and follows the [single source of truth]( principle. **Pokedex** is an offline-first app is an app that is able to perform all, or a critical subset of its core functionality without access to the internet. So users don't need to be up-to-date on the network resources every time and it will decrease users' data consumption. For further information, you can check out [Build an offline-first app]( ## Modularization **Pokedex** adopted modularization strategies below: - **Reusability**: Modulizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time. - **Parallel Building**: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time. - **Strict visibility control**: Modules restrict to expose dedicated components and access to other layers, so it prevents they're being used outside the module - **Decentralized focusing**: Each developer team can assign their dedicated module and they can focus on their own modules. For more information, check out the [Guide to Android app modularization]( ## MAD Score ## Open API Pokedex using the [PokeAPI]( for constructing RESTful API. PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokmon. ## Find this repository useful? :heart: Support it by joining __[stargazers]( for this repository. :star: Also, __[follow me]( on GitHub for my next creations! # License ```xml Designed and developed by 2022 skydoves (Jaewoong Eum) Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License""); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Built by [gskinner]( in partnership with Google, these vignettes range from the practical to the novel. They aim to inspire both developers and designers to build delightful and beautiful experiences with Flutter. In addition to forking and reviewing the [MIT licensed code](LICENSE.md) available here, you can also check out more information on the [Vignette Showcase Website]( ### About gskinner We exist to build inovative digital experiences for smart clients, and we love how easy Flutter makes that. Don't hesitate to [stop by our site]( to learn more about what we do. We'd love to hear from you! ### The Vignettes Travel Cards Use a Stack widget to create a parallax effect inside of a list, while also using a Transform to give it a 3D card effect. View Code Mindfulness Gooey Transition Draw curved vector paths and use them to mask content. Utilizes a small physics simulation to calculate tension between a set of points.

View Code ### Installation If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions]( Once you're set up and can compile the sample Flutter app, you're ready to run some vignettes! Each vignette is stored in its own folder in the repository. Using your IDE of choice, open the vignette directory you'd like to run. Then, using the terminal inside your IDE, run `flutter pub get` to fetch any dependencies, and `flutter run` to deploy to your connected device or simulator. If you would like to try these for Flutter for web, you can use `flutter run -d chrome`. Note that Flutter for web is currently a technical preview and not all of the vignettes will work correctly. For more information on enabling Flutter for web follow the [setup instructions]( ### License These vignettes are released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). You can use the code for any purpose, including commercial projects.

hive,isar/hive,3894,['Dart'],"['flutter', 'dart', 'key-value', 'nosql', 'encryption']","Fast, Enjoyable & Secure NoSQL Database Hive is a lightweight and buzzing-fast key-value database made for Flutter and Dart. ## Features - Bee everywhere: mobile, desktop, browser - Buzzing speed: Faster than a bee on caffeine! - Sweet, powerful, & intuitive API - Queen's Guard: Encryption built right in. - Thinking in swarms: Multi-isolate support. - Everything a bee needs and more! > Bee fact: A single bee can visit 5,000 flowers in a day! ## Buzz into Action Feeling the excitement? Great! Let's help you take your first flight with Hive. #### Add dependencies To kickstart the journey add `hive`, `isar_flutter_libs` and `path_provider` to your `pubspec.yaml`. ```yaml dependencies: hive: ^4.0.0 isar_flutter_libs: ^4.0.0-dev.13 path_provider: ^2.1.0 ``` Pssst! `path_provider` will help you to find the optimal directory for each platform. #### Designate a Home Hive needs a place to call home. Using `path_provider` we can find a valid directory. ```dart void main() async { WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory(); Hive.defaultDirectory = dir.path; // ... } ``` #### And... Action! Woohoo! You're all set. Jump in and let your Hive adventure begin! ```dart import 'package:hive/hive.dart'; final box = Hive.box(); box.put('name', 'David'); final name = box.get('name'); print('Name: $name'); ``` > Bee fact: Honeybees can fly at a speed of up to 30 kilometers per hour! # Hive Handbook In Hive, data is neatly organized into containers known as boxes. Think of boxes as tables you'd find in SQL, but far more flexible they don't stick to a set structure and can contain a variety of data. Boxes can be encrypted to store sensitive data. ## Table of Contents Want to jump to a specific section? Here's a handy table of contents: - [Opening Boxes](#-opening-boxes) - [Closing Boxes](#-bidding-adieu-closing-boxes) - [Inserting](#-filling-the-honeycomb-inserting-data) - [Reading](#-extracting-honey-i-mean-data) - [Deleting](#-deleting-data) - [Using Boxes like Lists](#-using-boxes-like-lists) - [Type safety](#-type-safety) - [Non-primitive Objects](#-bee-yond-the-basics-non-primitive-objects) - [Transactions](#-transactions) - [Isolates](#-the-isolate-dance) - [FAQ](#-buzzworthy-questions) > Bee fact: Bees have five eyes three simple eyes on top of the head, and two compound eyes, with numerous hexagonal facets. ### Opening Boxes Your journey with Hive begins with opening your first box. Trust me, it's unbee-lievably easy: ```dart final box = Hive.box(name: 'myBox'); ``` When you call `Hive.box(name: 'myBox')` for the first time with a given name, Hive will create a new box for you. If you call it again with the same name, Hive will return the already existing box. You can also use `Hive.box()` without providing a name. In this case, Hive will return the default box. There are optional parameters you can pass to `Hive.box()`: | Parameter | Description | | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | `name` | Label your box with a distinct name | | `directory` | Select a home for your box. If omitted, Hive uses the `defaultDirectory`. | | `encryptionKey` | Hand over this key, and Hive will encrypt your box. Keep it safe! | | `maxSizeMiB` | The maximum size of the box in MiB. Go for a modest number. | > Bee fact: Beeswax, which is secreted from the abdomen of worker bees, is used to construct the honeycomb. ### Bidding Adieu: Closing Boxes It's not advised to close boxes that might be accessed again. This prevents unnecessary overhead of reopening the box and ensures smooth data retrieval. To close a box just call `box.close()`. Wipe the box from the face of the earth with `box.deleteFromDisk()`. > Bee fact: When a bee finds a good source of nectar, it flies back to the hive and shows its friends where the nectar source is by doing a dance. ### Filling the Honeycomb: Inserting Data Once we have a box, it's time to fill it with sweet data! At its core, a box is just a key-value store. String keys are mapped to arbitrary primitive values. You can think of a box as a persisted `Map`. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.put('danceMoves', 'Waggle Dance'); box.put('wingSpeed', 200); ``` Updating values? If a particular key already exists, Hive simply updates its corresponding value. And complex types like lists and maps? They're in too! ```dart box.put('friends', ['Buzzy', 'Stinger', 'Honey']); box.put('memories', {'firstFlight': 'Sunny Day', 'bestNectar': 'Rose'}); ``` Instead of `.put()` you prefer the syntax of maps? Hive gets you: ```dart box['danceMoves'] = 'Round Dance'; box['wingSpeed'] = 220; ``` Got a bucket of honey facts? Drop them all at once with `box.putAll()`: ```dart box.putAll({'favoriteFlower': 'Lavender', 'wingSpeed': 210}); ``` > Bee fact: A single bee colony can produce anywhere from 30 to 100 pounds of honey in a year, depending on the availability of nectar sources. ### Extracting Honey... I mean, Data! Need a snippet of info from your Hive? No need to don the beekeeper suit; just scoop it out using `box.get()` or `box.getAll()`. If a key doesn't exist, `box.get()` simply return a `null`. But fret not; you can tell it to have a backup plan: ```dart final box = Hive.box(name: 'beeees'); final fav = box.get('favoriteFlower'); final moves = box.get('danceMoves', defaultValue: 'waggle'); ``` Oh, and if you're feeling fancy, use the `[]` operator for a more stylish approach: ```dart final fav = box['favoriteFlower']; final moves = box['danceMoves'] ?? 'waggle'; ``` > Bee fact: Worker bees are the only bees most people ever see flying around outside the hive. They're female, and their roles are to forage for food, build and protect the hive, and more. ### Deleting Data Time for some spring cleaning in the hive! To remove a single entry from your box, use `box.delete()`: ```dart final deleted = box.delete('lavenderHoney'); print('Honey eaten: $deleted'); // Honey eaten: true ``` Perhaps it's time for a complete reset, making space for a fresh batch of honey. If you're looking to remove all key-value pairs from a box, use `box.clear()`: ```dart box.clear(); ``` > Bee fact: Bees have been around for more than 30 million years! Their long history predates the existence of humans and even dinosaurs. ### Using Boxes like Lists In the bee world, honeycombs aren't just random compartments; they're methodically organized. Similarly, while we've been viewing Hive boxes as maps so far, they can be used just like lists: ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Rose'); box.add('Tulip'); print(box.getAt(0)); // Rose print(box.getAt(1)); // Tulip ``` But remember, bees can't retrieve honey from a comb that's empty or doesn't exist. Likewise, index-based operations will throw an error if you try an index out of bounds: ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Daisy'); print(box.getAt(1)); // Error! This will make the bees buzz in confusion ``` Even if we insert a key-value pair we can still access the values by index. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Lily'); box.put('key', 'Orchid'); print(box.getAt(0)); // Lily print(box.getAt(1)); // Orchid ``` Of course, we can also use the `[]` operator in combination with indexes : ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Marigold'); print(box[0]); // Marigold box[0] = 'Daffodil'; box[1] = 'Bluebell'; // Error! This will get the bees in a whirl ``` > Bee fact: To produce one pound of honey, a hive's bees must visit 2 million flowers and fly over 55,000 miles. ### Type safety Safety is the bee's priority! To keep your data sweet and pure boxes have an optional generic type parameter. It allows you to store only values of a specific type in a box: ```dart final box = Hive.box(name: 'BeeTreasures'); box.put('DaisyDance', 'SweetNectarShake'); box.put('RoseRumba', 'GoldenPollenParty'); box.put('TulipTango', 777); // Error - You can't fool the bees! ``` Make sure to use the same type whenever you get the box. Otherwise, you'll get an error: ```dart Hive.box(name: 'BeeTreasures'); // Error - We already have a String box! ``` > Bee fact: Bees have two stomachs. One is for eating, and the other is for storing nectar collected from flowers or water so they can carry it back to their hive. Talk about a sweet backpack! ### Bee-yond the Basics: Non-primitive Objects Hive goes beyond storing just basic data types! Along with primitives, lists, and maps, Hive can store any Dart object of your liking. The only buzz you need to know? Your object should come equipped with a `.fromJson()` and `.toJson()` method: ```dart class Bee { Bee({required this.name, required this.role}); factory Bee.fromJson(Map json) => Bee( name: json['name'] as String, role: json['role'] as String, ); final String name; final String role; Map toJson() => { 'name': name, 'role': role, }; } ``` Before our bee-friends can buzz around in Hive, you need to do the beekeeper's job and register the `Bee` class: ```dart Hive.registerAdapter('Bee', Bee.fromJson); ``` Now, you're all set to let your bees fly: ```dart final box = Hive.box(); final bumble = Bee(name: 'Bumble', role: 'Worker'); box.put('BumbleID', bumble); print(box.get('BumbleID')); // Bumble - Worker ``` > Bee fact: Bees are responsible for pollinating about one-third of the world's food crops. ### Transactions Transactions are an efficient way to update multiple values at once. They are also useful if you want to make sure that a Box is not changed by other code while you are working with it. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.write(() { box.store('nectar1', 'GoldenNectar'); box.store('nectar2', 'WildflowerBrew'); box.store('nectar3', 'CloverDew'); }); box.read(() { box.get('nectar1'); // GoldenNectar }); ``` Changes made in a transaction are always atomic. Either all changes are applied or none of them. So if an error occurs during a transaction, the box will not be changed. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.put('honeyLevel', 5); box.write(() { box.put('honeyLevel', 6); throw Exception('Oh no!!!'); }); print(box.get('honeyLevel')); // 5 ``` > Bee fact: Bees can recognize human faces, and they can even be trained to associate a picture of a face with sweet treats! ### The Isolate Dance Just like a beehive where multiple bees work simultaneously, you can buzz into Hive from various Isolates at the same time. This nifty trick is great when you wish to keep those database activities separate from your UI thread. Hive comes with a sweet `Hive.compute()` method that runs a function in a different isolate. The best part? It also does the honey-making job of setting up and tidying resources for you. ```dart // Opening the bee's box final box = Hive.box(); // Storing some sweet nectar box.put('nectarType', 'wildflower'); await Hive.compute(() { // Accessing the same box from another worker bee final box = Hive.box(); print(box.get('nectarType')); // wildflower // Updating the nectar's quality box.put('nectarType', 'lavender'); }); // Tasting the updated honey flavor print(honeycomb.get('nectarType')); // lavender ``` Just remember, while the bees dance in harmony, ensure your Isolates do too! > Bee fact: Bees have two pairs of wings, and they beat 11,400 times per minute. ### Buzzworthy Questions #### To bee or not to bee: Hive or Isar? > It's not always black and yellow! Both Hive and Isar have their sweet spots. Hive is a lightweight wrapper around Isar so if you are looking for a simple key-value store, Hive might be enough. Isar is the way to go if you need queries, relations, and more advanced features. #### Will using Hive make my app as fast as a bee? > While we can't promise your app will gain wings, Hive sure will give it the speed it deserves. Hive is very resource efficient and optimized for mobile devices. Flutter like a butterfly, sting like a bee! #### Where in the beehive does Hive hide my honey... I mean, data? > Remember the `defaultDirectory` we set at the beginning? That's where Hive stores your data in a file named `yourBoxName.isar` or `yourBoxName.sqlite`. #### I've got some bee-autiful images! Can I store them directly in Hive? > While you might be tempted to put those pics right into Hive, it's best to store your images and other binary data as files outside Hive. You can then store the file path in Hive. Think of it like leaving honey out in the open; it's better to keep it neatly stored in the appropriate place. #### Yikes! What if my app meets an untimely demise (gets killed)? What becomes of my Hive? > No need for a bee-mergency! If your app buzzes off unexpectedly, Hive ensures that your data remains safe and sound. Transactions are atomic, so either all changes are applied or none of them. If an error occurs during a transaction, the box will not be changed. #### How does Hive keep our data safe from sticky fingers? > We've got the queen's guard on duty! If you encrypt your box Hive uses 256-bit AES in CBC mode. Every database page is safeguarded separately, ensuring your sweet stuff remains secure and only accessible to those with the right key. Buzz-worthy protection, right? #### When should I rally the troops and use transactions? > Just like a hive making big decisions together, you'll want to use transactions when you have several operations that should be executed together.

flutter-folio,gskinnerTeam/flutter-folio,3807,"['Dart', 'C++', 'CMake']",[],"# Flutter Folio A demo app showcasing how Flutter can deliver a great multi-platform experience, targeting iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, and web. Built by [gskinner]( in partnership with Google, Flutter Folio purposefully considers user expectations, input devices and idioms for each platform, ensuring it feels at home on every device. In addition to forking and reviewing the [MIT licensed](LICENSE.md) code available here, you can check out more information on the [Flutter Folio Showcase Website]( ### About gskinner We exist to build innovative digital experiences for smart clients, and we love how easy Flutter makes that experience. Don't hesitate to [stop by our site]( to learn more about what we do. We'd love to hear from you! ### Demo Builds To preview the app you can download from the app store on your device by visiting: ### Installation If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions]( Once Flutter is setup, you can use the latest `stable` channel: * Run `flutter channel stable` * Run `flutter upgrade` Once you're on `dev` and desktop is enabled, you're ready to run the app: * `flutter run -d windows` * `flutter run -d macos` * `flutter run -d linux` * `flutter run -d android` * `flutter run -d ios` * `flutter run -d web` If you re-start your IDE, you should also see a new launch option for your current desktop platform. ### Client Keys This repo includes a set of Keys for Cloudinary and Firebase that are on the free pricing plans. Depending on traffic, these may reach their limit. If that happens, you will need to provide your own keys in order to run the app locally, those can be found in `AppKeys.dart`. These limits should refresh each month, so your mileage will vary here. ### License This application is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

wsa_pacman,alesimula/wsa_pacman,3805,"['Dart', 'C++', 'CMake']",[],"# wsa_pacman A GUI package manager and package installer for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA). Currently provides a double-click GUI installer for .apk and .xapk files that shows app information (package, icon, version and permissions), allows normal installations as well as upgrades and downgrades. The app additionally provides a button to open Android settings and one to open the ""Manage Applications"" Android settings page, from which you can uninstall or disable applications and grant or revoke permissions ## Settings - Autostart WSA - on/off - Android port - Default: 58526 - Language - [All options](./locale/) - Theme mode - System - Dark - Light - Window transparency (mica) - Full - Partial - Disabled - Adaptive icon shape - Squircle - Circle - Rounded square - Disabled ## FAQ **Q:** WSA PacMan is always showing the Offline status, why is that? **A:** First things first make sure WSA is installed (duh); Open the 'Windows Subsystem for Android Settings' app, in the Developer tab and make sure the 'Developer mode' switch is enabled; inside manage developer settings, make sure the 'USB debugging' option is enabled. Should all of the above fail, [try following this procedure]( make sure to check the 'always allow' option. ## **Q:** Can I use WSA PacMan on older versions of Windows (eg. Windows 10)? **A:** WSA PacMan depends on Windows Subsystem for Linux, which is only ***officially*** supported on Windows 11. However, you may be able to install WSA on Windows 10 [using this project]( by JimDude7404 and following the step-by-step guide on the GitHub page. ## **Q:** Can i install the Play Store? **A:** The play store is not _officially_ supported on WSA, and at the moment it is only possible to install it using an unofficial WSA build. I recommend installing the [Aurora Store]( instead, which is an unofficial Play Store client; but if you really want the Play Store and other Google apps, [check out this project]( ## More screenshots","823, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, wontfix, question, invalid, help wanted, good first issue, enhancement, duplicate, documentation, bug"
dart-sass,sass/dart-sass,3802,"['Dart', 'HTML', 'Shell']","['sass', 'css-preprocessor', 'dart', 'dart-sass']","A [Dart][dart] implementation of [Sass][sass]. **Sass makes CSS fun**. [dart]: [sass]: * [Using Dart Sass](#using-dart-sass) * [From Chocolatey or Scoop (Windows)](#from-chocolatey-or-scoop-windows) * [From Homebrew (macOS)](#from-homebrew-macos-or-linux) * [Standalone](#standalone) * [From npm](#from-npm) * [Dart Sass in the Browser](#dart-sass-in-the-browser) * [Legacy JavaScript API](#legacy-javascript-api) * [Using Sass with Jest](#using-sass-with-jest) * [From Pub](#from-pub) * [`sass_api` Package](#sass_api-package) * [From Source](#from-source) * [In Docker](#in-docker) * [Why Dart?](#why-dart) * [Compatibility Policy](#compatibility-policy) * [Browser Compatibility](#browser-compatibility) * [Node.js Compatibility](#nodejs-compatibility) * [Invalid CSS](#invalid-css) * [Embedded Dart Sass](#embedded-dart-sass) * [Usage](#usage) * [Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass](#behavioral-differences-from-ruby-sass) ## Using Dart Sass There are a few different ways to install and run Dart Sass, depending on your environment and your needs. ### From Chocolatey or Scoop (Windows) If you use [the Chocolatey package manager]( or [the Scoop package manager]( for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running ```cmd choco install sass ``` or ```cmd scoop install sass ``` That'll give you a `sass` executable on your command line that will run Dart Sass. See [the CLI docs][cli] for details. [cli]: ### From Homebrew (macOS or Linux) If you use [the Homebrew package manager]( you can install Dart Sass by running ```sh brew install sass/sass/sass ``` That'll give you a `sass` executable on your command line that will run Dart Sass. ### Standalone You can download the standalone Dart Sass archive for your operating systemcontaining the Dart VM and the snapshot of the executablefrom [the GitHub release page][]. Extract it, [add the directory to your path][], restart your terminal, and the `sass` executable is ready to run! [the GitHub release page]: [add the directory to your path]: ### From npm Dart Sass is available, compiled to JavaScript, [as an npm package][npm]. You can install it globally using `npm install -g sass` which will provide access to the `sass` executable. You can also add it to your project using `npm install --save-dev sass`. This provides the executable as well as a library: [npm]: ```js const sass = require('sass'); const result = sass.compile(scssFilename); // OR // Note that `compileAsync()` is substantially slower than `compile()`. const result = await sass.compileAsync(scssFilename); ``` See [the Sass website][js api] for full API documentation. [js api]: #### Dart Sass in the Browser The `sass` npm package can also be run directly in the browser. It's compatible with all major web bundlers as long as you disable renaming (such as [`--keep-names`] in esbuild). You can also import it directly from a browser as an ECMAScript Module without any bundling (assuming `node_modules` is served as well): [`--keep-names`]: ```html ``` Or from a CDN: ```html ``` Or even bundled with all its dependencies: ```html ``` Since the browser doesn't have access to the filesystem, the [`compile()`] and `compileAsync()` functions aren't available for it. If you want to load other files, you'll need to pass a [custom importer] to [`compileString()`] or [`compileStringAsync()`]. The [legacy API] is also not supported in the browser. [`compile()`]: [`compileAsync()`]: [custom importer]: [`compileString()`]: [`compileStringAsync()`]: [legacy API]: #legacy-javascript-api #### Legacy JavaScript API Dart Sass also supports an older JavaScript API that's fully compatible with [Node Sass] (with a few exceptions listed below), with support for both the [`render()`] and [`renderSync()`] functions. This API is considered deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0, so it should be avoided in new projects. [Node Sass]: [`render()`]: [`renderSync()`]: Sass's support for the legacy JavaScript API has the following limitations: * Only the `""expanded""` and `""compressed""` values of [`outputStyle`] are supported. * Dart Sass doesn't support the [`precision`] option. Dart Sass defaults to a sufficiently high precision for all existing browsers, and making this customizable would make the code substantially less efficient. * Dart Sass doesn't support the [`sourceComments`] option. Source maps are the recommended way of locating the origin of generated selectors. [`outputStyle`]: [`precision`]: [`sourceComments`]: #### Using Sass with Jest If you're using [Jest] to run your tests, be aware that it has a [longstanding bug] where its default test environment breaks JavaScript's built-in [`instanceof` operator]. Dart Sass's JS package uses `instanceof` fairly heavily, so in order to avoid breaking Sass you'll need to install [`jest-environment-node-single-context`] and add `testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-node-single-context'` to your Jest config. [Jest]: [longstanding bug]: [`instanceof` operator]: [`jest-environment-node-single-context`]: ### From Pub If you're a Dart user, you can install Dart Sass globally using `pub global activate sass`, which will provide a `sass` executable. You can also add it to your pubspec and use it as a library. We strongly recommend importing it with the prefix `sass`: ```dart import 'package:sass/sass.dart' as sass; void main(List args) { print(sass.compile(args.first)); } ``` See [the Dart API docs][api] for details. [api]: #### `sass_api` Package Dart users also have access to more in-depth APIs via the [`sass_api` package]. This provides access to the Sass AST and APIs for resolving Sass loads without running a full compilation. It's separated out into its own package so that it can increase its version number independently of the main `sass` package. [`sass_api` package]: ### From Source Assuming you've already checked out this repository: 1. [Install Dart]( If you download an archive manually rather than using an installer, make sure the SDK's `bin` directory is on your `PATH`. 2. [Install Buf]. This is used to build the protocol buffers for the [embedded compiler]. 3. In this repository, run `dart pub get`. This will install Dart Sass's dependencies. 4. Run `dart run grinder protobuf`. This will download and build the embedded protocol definition. 5. Run `dart bin/sass.dart path/to/file.scss`. [Install Buf]: [embedded compiler]: #embedded-dart-sass That's it! ### In Docker You can install and run Dart Sass within Docker using the following Dockerfile commands: ```Dockerfile # Dart stage FROM bufbuild/buf AS buf FROM dart:stable AS dart # Add your scss files COPY --from=another_stage /app /app # Include Protocol Buffer binary COPY --from=buf /usr/local/bin/buf /usr/local/bin/ WORKDIR /dart-sass RUN git clone . && \ dart pub get && \ dart run grinder protobuf # This is where you run sass.dart on your scss file(s) RUN dart ./bin/sass.dart /app/sass/example.scss /app/public/css/example.css ``` ## Why Dart? Dart Sass has replaced Ruby Sass as the canonical implementation of the Sass language. We chose Dart because it presented a number of advantages: * It's fast. The Dart VM is highly optimized, and getting faster all the time (for the latest performance numbers, see [`perf.md`][perf]). It's much faster than Ruby, and close to par with C++. * It's portable. The Dart VM has no external dependencies and can compile applications into standalone snapshot files, so we can distribute Dart Sass as only three files (the VM, the snapshot, and a wrapper script). Dart can also be compiled to JavaScript, which makes it easy to distribute Sass through npm, which the majority of our users use already. * It's easy to write. Dart is a higher-level language than C++, which means it doesn't require lots of hassle with memory management and build systems. It's also statically typed, which makes it easier to confidently make large refactors than with Ruby. * It's friendlier to contributors. Dart is substantially easier to learn than Ruby, and many Sass users in Google in particular are already familiar with it. More contributors translates to faster, more consistent development. [perf]: ## Compatibility Policy For the most part, Dart Sass follows [semantic versioning][]. We consider all of the following to be part of the versioned API: [semantic versioning]: * The Sass language semantics implemented by Dart Sass. * The Dart API. * The JavaScript API. * The command-line interface. Because Dart Sass has a single version that's shared across the Dart, JavaScript, and standalone distributions, this may mean that we increment the major version number when there are in fact no breaking changes for one or more distributions. However, we will attempt to limit the number of breaking changes we make and group them in as few releases as possible to minimize churn. We strongly encourage users to use [the changelog][] for a full understanding of all the changes in each release. [the changelog]: There is one exception where breaking changes may be made outside of a major version revision. It is occasionally the case that CSS adds a feature that's incompatible with existing Sass syntax in some way. Because Sass is committed to full CSS compatibility, we occasionally need to break compatibility with old Sass code in order to remain compatible with CSS. In these cases, we will first release a version of Sass that emits deprecation warnings for any stylesheets whose behavior will change. Then, at least three months after the release of a version with these deprecation warnings, we will release a minor version with the breaking change to the Sass language semantics. ### Browser Compatibility In general, we consider any change to Dart Sass's CSS output that would cause that CSS to stop working in a real browser to be a breaking change. However, there are some cases where such a change would have substantial benefits and would only negatively affect a small minority of rarely-used browsers. We don't want to have to block such a change on a major version release. As such, if a change would break compatibility with less than 2% of the global market share of browser according to [StatCounter GlobalStats][], we may release a minor version of Dart Sass with that change. [StatCounter GlobalStats]: ### Node.js Compatibility We consider dropping support for a given version of Node.js to be a breaking change *as long as* that version is still supported by Node.js. This means that releases listed as Current, Active LTS, or Maintenance LTS according to [the Node.js release page][]. Once a Node.js version is out of LTS, Dart Sass considers itself free to break support if necessary. [the Node.js release page]: ### Invalid CSS Changes to the behavior of Sass stylesheets that produce invalid CSS output are _not_ considered breaking changes. Such changes are almost always necessary when adding support for new CSS features, and delaying all such features until a new major version would be unduly burdensome for most users. For example, when Sass began parsing `calc()` expressions, the invalid expression `calc(1 +)` became a Sass error where before it was passed through as-is. This was not considered a breaking change, because `calc(1 +)` was never valid CSS to begin with. ## Embedded Dart Sass Dart Sass includes an implementation of the compiler side of the [Embedded Sass protocol]. It's designed to be embedded in a host language, which then exposes an API for users to invoke Sass and define custom functions and importers. [Embedded Sass protocol]: ### Usage * `sass --embedded` starts the embedded compiler and listens on stdin. * `sass --embedded --version` prints `versionResponse` with `id = 0` in JSON and exits. The `--embedded` command-line flag is not available when you install Dart Sass as an [npm package]. No other command-line flags are supported with `--embedded`. [npm package]: #from-npm ## Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass There are a few intentional behavioral differences between Dart Sass and Ruby Sass. These are generally places where Ruby Sass has an undesired behavior, and it's substantially easier to implement the correct behavior than it would be to implement compatible behavior. These should all have tracking bugs against Ruby Sass to update the reference behavior. 1. `@extend` only accepts simple selectors, as does the second argument of `selector-extend()`. See [issue 1599][]. 2. Subject selectors are not supported. See [issue 1126][]. 3. Pseudo selector arguments are parsed as ``s rather than having a more limited custom parsing. See [issue 2120][]. 4. The numeric precision is set to 10. See [issue 1122][]. 5. The indented syntax parser is more flexible: it doesn't require consistent indentation across the whole document. See [issue 2176][]. 6. Colors do not support channel-by-channel arithmetic. See [issue 2144][]. 7. Unitless numbers aren't `==` to unit numbers with the same value. In addition, map keys follow the same logic as `==`-equality. See [issue 1496][]. 8. `rgba()` and `hsla()` alpha values with percentage units are interpreted as percentages. Other units are forbidden. See [issue 1525][]. 9. Too many variable arguments passed to a function is an error. See [issue 1408][]. 10. Allow `@extend` to reach outside a media query if there's an identical `@extend` defined outside that query. This isn't tracked explicitly, because it'll be irrelevant when [issue 1050][] is fixed. 11. Some selector pseudos containing placeholder selectors will be compiled where they wouldn't be in Ruby Sass. This better matches the semantics of the selectors in question, and is more efficient. See [issue 2228][]. 12. The old-style `:property value` syntax is not supported in the indented syntax. See [issue 2245][]. 13. The reference combinator is not supported. See [issue 303][]. 14. Universal selector unification is symmetrical. See [issue 2247][]. 15. `@extend` doesn't produce an error if it matches but fails to unify. See [issue 2250][]. 16. Dart Sass currently only supports UTF-8 documents. We'd like to support more, but Dart currently doesn't support them. See [dart-lang/sdk#11744][], for example.

Zero-config setup, integrated hotreloading, and signals-based state management. Add backend functionality with Server Functions and bundle with our CLI. ```rust fn app() -> Element { let mut count = use_signal(|| 0); rsx! { h1 { ""High-Five counter: {count}"" } button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, ""Up high!"" } button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, ""Down low!"" } } } ``` ## Unique features: - Cross-platform apps in three lines of code (web, desktop, mobile, server, and more) - [Ergonomic state management]( combines the best of React, Solid, and Svelte - Extremely performant, powered by Rust's fastest wasm-framework [sledgehammer]( - Integrated bundler for deploying to the web, macOS, Linux, and Windows - And more! Read the [take a tour of Dioxus]( ## Instant hot-reloading With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup and styles and see the results in real time. Rust code hotreloading is not yet 1st class, but possible with [hot-lib-reloader]( ## Bundler for deploying to the web and desktop Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification]( and more. Build webapps weighing [less than 50kb]( and desktop/mobile apps less than 15mb. ## Fantastic documentation We've put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our docsite runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website]( for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new diouxs features - [check it out!]( ## Emphasis on developer experience Dioxus prioritizes developer experience, and we've put a ton of effort into end-to-end tooling. We've built a [VSCode extension]( that autoformats your RSX code, converts HTML to RSX, and more. We've also built a very powerful [CLI]( that supports creating new apps, serving them, and cross-platform bundling, with deployment on the roadmap. ## Community Dioxus is a community-driven project, with a very active [Discord]( and [GitHub]( community. We're always looking for help, and we're happy to answer questions and help you get started. [Our SDK]( is community-run and we even have a [GitHub organization]( for the best Dioxus crates that receive free upgrades and support. ## Full-time core team Dioxus has grown from a side project to a small team of fulltime engineers. Thanks to the generous support of FutureWei, Satellite.im, the GitHub Accelerator program, we're able to work on Dioxus full-time. Our long term goal is for Dioxus to become self-sustaining by providing paid high-quality enterprise tools. If your company is interested in adopting Dioxus and would like to work with us, please reach out! ## Supported Platforms Web Tier 1 Support Render directly to the DOM using WebAssembly Pre-render with SSR and rehydrate on the client Simple ""hello world"" at about 50kb, comparable to React Built-in dev server and hot reloading for quick iteration Fullstack Tier 1 Support Suspense, hydration, and server-side rendering Quickly drop in backend functionality with server functions Extractors, middleware, and routing integrations Compatible with desktop and mobile! Desktop Tier 1 Support Render using Webview or - experimentally - with WGPU or Freya (skia) Zero-config setup. Simply `cargo run` or `dx serve` to build your app Full support for native system access without IPC Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. Portable <3mb binaries Liveview Tier 1 Support Render apps - or just a single component - entirely on the server Integrations with popular Rust frameworks like Axum and Warp Extremely low-latency and ability to support 10,000+ simultaneous apps Mobile Tier 2 Support Render using Webview or - experimentally - with WGPU or Skia Support for iOS and Android Currently quite experimental, with lots of improvements coming throughout 2024 Terminal Tier 2 Support Render apps directly into your terminal, similar to ink.js Powered by the familiar flexbox and CSS model of the browser Built-in widgets like text input, buttons, and focus system ## Running the examples The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with `cargo run --example `. However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli and run the examples with `dx serve` since many examples also support web. When running for web, you either need to modify the Cargo.toml to disable the default desktop feature, or use ## Dioxus vs other frameworks We love all frameworks and enjoy watching innovation in the Rust ecosystem. In fact, many of our projects are shared with other frameworks. For example, our flex-box library [Taffy]( is used by [Bevy]( [Zed]( [Lapce]( [Iced]( and many more. Dioxus places an emphasis on a few key points that make it different from other frameworks: - **React-like**: we rely on concepts like components, props, and hooks to build UIs, with our state management being closer to Svelte than to SolidJS. - **HTML and CSS**: we lean completely into HTML and CSS, quirks and all. - **Renderer-agnostic**: you can swap out the renderer for any platform you want thanks to [our fast VirtualDOM]( - **Collaborative**: whenever possible, we spin out crates like [Taffy]( [magnanis]( [include_mdbook]( and [blitz]( so the ecosystem can grow together. ### Dioxus vs Tauri Tauri is a framework for building desktop (and soon, mobile) apps where your frontend is written in a web-based framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Whenever you need to do native work, you can write Rust functions and call them from your frontend. - **Natively Rust**: Tauri's architecture limits your UI to either JavaScript or WebAssembly. With Dioxus, your Rust code is running natively on the user's machine, letting you do things like spawning threads, accessing the filesystem, without any IPC bridge. This drastically simplifies your app's architecture and makes it easier to build. You can build a Tauri app with Dioxus-Web as a frontend if you'd like. - **Different scopes**: Tauri needs to support JavaScript and its complex build tooling, limiting the scope of what you can do with it. Since Dioxus is exclusively focused on Rust, we're able to provide extra utilities like Server Functions, advanced bundling, and a native renderer. - **Shared DNA**: While Tauri and Dioxus are separate projects, they do share libraries like Tao and Wry: windowing and webview libraries maintained by the Tauri team. ### Dioxus vs Leptos Leptos is a library for building fullstack web-apps, similar to SolidJS and SolidStart. The two libraries share similar goals on the web, but have several key differences: - **Reactivity model**: Leptos uses signals for its underlying reactivity, while Dioxus opts for a VirtualDom and re-renders. While in theory signals are more efficient, in practice, Dioxus' VirtualDom performs little-to-no actual diffing (thanks to our [block-dom inspired templates]( and is [actually faster than Leptos]( - **Control flow**: Because Leptos uses signals for reactivity, you are constrained to Leptos' primitives for things like `for` loops and `if` statements. If you get this wrong, your app will lose reactivity, leading to hard to debug UI issues. With Dioxus, you can use iterators, regular Rust `for` loops and `if` statements, and your app will still be reactive. In practice, a Dioxus component to insert counters into a list might look like this: ```rust fn Counters() -> Element { let mut counters = use_signal(|| vec![0; 10]); rsx! { button { onclick: move |_| counters.push(counters.len()), ""Add Counter"" } ul { for idx in 0..counters.len() { li { button { onclick: move |_| counters.write()[idx] += 1, ""{counters.index(idx)}"" } button { onclick: move |_| { counters.remove(idx); }, ""Remove"" } } } } } } ``` [While in Leptos you would use the `` component.]( ```rust fn Counters() -> impl IntoView { let counters = RwSignal::new(vec![0; 10]); view! { ""Add Counter"" {Memo::new(move |_| counters.with(|n| n[idx]))} ""Remove"" } } ``` - **`Copy` state**: Dioxus 0.1 to 0.4 relied on lifetimes to relax the rules of Rust's borrow checker. This worked well for event handlers, but struggled around async. In Dioxus 0.5, we've switched to a [`Copy` state model]( borrowed from Leptos. - **Different scopes**: Dioxus provides renderers for web, desktop, mobile, LiveView, and more. We also maintain community libraries and a cross-platform SDK. The scope of this work is huge, meaning we've historically released at a slower cadence than Leptos. Leptos focuses on the fullstack web, with features that Dioxus doesn't have like ``-based streaming HTML, islands, `` components, and other web-specific features. Generally, web apps you build with Leptos will have a smaller footprint. - **Different DSLs**: While both frameworks target the web, Dioxus uses its own custom Rust-like DSL for building UIs while Leptos uses a more HTML-like syntax. We chose this to retain compatibility with IDE features like codefolding and syntax highlighting. Generally, Dioxus leans into more ""magic"" with its DSL. For example, dioxus will automatically format strings for you while Leptos can split up strings into static and dynamic segments. ```rust // dioxus rsx! { div { class: ""my-class"", enabled: true, ""Hello, {name}"" } } // leptos view! { ""Hello "" {name} } ``` ### Dioxus vs Yew Yew is a framework for building single-page web apps and initially served as an inspiration for Dioxus. Unfortunately, the architecture of Yew didn't support the various features we wanted, and thus Dioxus was born. - **Single-page apps**: Yew is designed exclusively for single-page web apps and is instrinsically tied to the web platform. Dioxus is fullstack and crossplatform, making it suitable for building web, desktop, mobile, and server apps. - **Developer Tooling**: Dioxus provides a number of utilities like autoformatting, hotreloading, and a bundler. - **Ongoing support**: Dioxus is very actively maintained with new features and bug fixes being added on a daily basis. ### Dioxus vs egui egui is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust powering tools like [Rerun.io]( - **Immediate vs Retained**: egui is designed to be re-rendered on every frame. This is suitable for games and other interactive applications, but it does not retain style and layout state between frames. Dioxus is a retained UI framework, meaning that the UI is built once and then modified between frames. This enables Dioxus to use native web technologies like HTML and CSS with better battery life and performance. - **Customizable**: egui brings its own styling and layout solution while Dioxus expects you to use the built-in HTML and CSS. This enables dioxus apps to use any CSS library like Tailwind or Material UI. - **State management**: egui's state management is based on a single global state object. Dioxus encourages encapsulation of state by using components and props, making components more reusable. ### Dioxus vs Iced Iced is a cross-platform GUI library inspired by Elm. Iced renders natively with WGPU and supports the web using DOM nodes. - **Elm state management**: Iced uses Elm's state management model, which is based on message passing and reducers. This is simply a different state management model than Dioxus and can be rather verbose at times. - **Native Feel**: Since Dioxus uses a webview as its renderer, it automatically gets native text input, paste handling, and other native features like accessibility. Iced's renderer currently doesn't implement these features, making it feel less native. - **WGPU**: Dioxus' WGPU renderer is currently quite immature and not yet reader for production use. Iced's WGPU renderer is much more mature and is being used in production. This enables certain types of apps that need GPU access to be built with Iced that can't currently be built with Dioxus. ### Dioxus vs Electron Dioxus and Electron are two entirely different projects with similar goals. Electron makes it possible for developers to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. - **Lightweight**: Dioxus uses the system's native WebView - or optionally, a WGPU renderer - to render the UI. This makes a typical Dioxus app about 15mb on macOS in comparison to Electron's 100mb. Electron also ships an embedded chromium instance which cannot share system resources with the host OS in the same way as Dioxus. - **Maturity**: Electron is a mature project with a large community and a lot of tooling. Dioxus is still quite young in comparison to Electron. Expect to run into features like deeplinking that require extra work to implement. ## Contributing - Check out the website [section on contributing]( - Report issues on our [issue tracker]( - [Join]( the discord and ask questions! ## License This project is licensed under the [MIT license].

Payload supports a wide range of data types and query conditions, including keyword matching, full-text filtering, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more. Filtering conditions can be combined in various ways, including `should`, `must`, and `must_not` clauses, ensuring that you can implement any desired business logic on top of similarity matching. ### Hybrid Search with Sparse Vectors To address the limitations of vector embeddings when searching for specific keywords, Qdrant introduces support for sparse vectors in addition to the regular dense ones. Sparse vectors can be viewed as an generalisation of BM25 or TF-IDF ranking. They enable you to harness the capabilities of transformer-based neural networks to weigh individual tokens effectively. ### Vector Quantization and On-Disk Storage Qdrant provides multiple options to make vector search cheaper and more resource-efficient. Built-in vector quantization reduces RAM usage by up to 97% and dynamically manages the trade-off between search speed and precision. ### Distributed Deployment Qdrant offers comprehensive horizontal scaling support through two key mechanisms: 1. Size expansion via sharding and throughput enhancement via replication 2. Zero-downtime rolling updates and seamless dynamic scaling of the collections ### Highlighted Features * **Query Planning and Payload Indexes** - leverages stored payload information to optimize query execution strategy. * **SIMD Hardware Acceleration** - utilizes modern CPU x86-x64 and Neon architectures to deliver better performance. * **Async I/O** - uses `io_uring` to maximize disk throughput utilization even on a network-attached storage. * **Write-Ahead Logging** - ensures data persistence with update confirmation, even during power outages. # Integrations Examples and/or documentation of Qdrant integrations: - [Cohere]( ([blogpost on building a QA app with Cohere and Qdrant]( - Use Cohere embeddings with Qdrant - [DocArray]( - Use Qdrant as a document store in DocArray - [Haystack]( - Use Qdrant as a document store with Haystack ([blogpost]( - [LangChain]( ([blogpost]( - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for LangChain. - [LlamaIndex]( - Use Qdrant as a Vector Store with LlamaIndex. - [OpenAI - ChatGPT retrieval plugin]( - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for ChatGPT - [Microsoft Semantic Kernel]( - Use Qdrant as persistent memory with Semantic Kernel ## Contacts - Have questions?

Additionally, it provides optional and _fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin server. exit code, duration, time and command shown As well as the search UI, it can do things like this: ``` # search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday atuin search --exit 0 --after ""yesterday 3pm"" make ``` You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don't use sync at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn't access your data even if I wanted to. And I **really** don't want to. ## Features - rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI - store shell history in a sqlite database - back up and sync **encrypted** shell history - the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines - log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc - calculate statistics such as ""most used command"" - old history file is not replaced - quick-jump to previous items with Alt-\ - switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally - enter to execute a command, tab to edit ## Documentation - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Install](#install) - [Import]( - [Configuration]( - [Searching history]( - [Cloud history sync]( - [History stats]( - [Self host Atuin server]( - [Key binding]( - [Shell completions]( ## Supported Shells - zsh - bash - fish - nushell - xonsh ## Community ### Forum Atuin has a community forum, please ask here for help and support: ### Discord Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here]( # Quickstart ## With the default sync server This will sign you up for the default sync server, hosted by me. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe!

RustPython,RustPython/RustPython,17796,"['Rust', 'Python', 'JavaScript']","['rust', 'python3', 'python-language', 'jit', 'interpreter']","# [RustPython]( A Python-3 (CPython >= 3.12.0) Interpreter written in Rust :snake: :scream: :metal:. []( []( []( []( [][discord] []( []( []( []( []( ## Usage **Check out our [online demo]( running on WebAssembly.** RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.67.1 at February 7th 2023). If you don't currently have Rust installed on your system you can do so by following the instructions at [rustup.rs]( To check the version of Rust you're currently running, use `rustc --version`. If you wish to update, `rustup update stable` will update your Rust installation to the most recent stable release. To build RustPython locally, first, clone the source code: ```bash git clone ``` Then you can change into the RustPython directory and run the demo (Note: `--release` is needed to prevent stack overflow on Windows): ```bash $ cd RustPython $ cargo run --release demo_closures.py Hello, RustPython! ``` Or use the interactive shell: ```bash $ cargo run --release Welcome to rustpython >>>>> 2+2 4 ``` NOTE: For windows users, please set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` environment variable as `Lib` path in project directory. (e.g. When RustPython directory is `C:\RustPython`, set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` as `C:\RustPython\Lib`) You can also install and run RustPython with the following: ```bash $ cargo install --git $ rustpython Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter >>>>> ``` If you'd like to make requests, you can enable the `ssl` feature, which also lets you install the `pip` package manager. Note that on Windows, you may need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead, which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`. OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work. Once you've installed rustpython with SSL support, you can install pip by running: ```bash cargo install --git --features ssl rustpython --install-pip ``` You can also install RustPython through the `conda` package manager, though this isn't officially supported and may be out of date: ```bash conda install rustpython -c conda-forge rustpython ``` ### WASI You can compile RustPython to a standalone WebAssembly WASI module so it can run anywhere. Build ```bash cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --no-default-features --features freeze-stdlib,stdlib --release ``` Run by wasmer ```bash wasmer run --dir `pwd` -- target/wasm32-wasi/release/rustpython.wasm `pwd`/extra_tests/snippets/stdlib_random.py ``` Run by wapm ```bash $ wapm install rustpython $ wapm run rustpython >>>>> 2+2 4 ``` #### Building the WASI file You can build the WebAssembly WASI file with: ```bash cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi --features=""freeze-stdlib"" ``` > Note: we use the `freeze-stdlib` to include the standard library inside the binary. You also have to run once `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`. ### JIT (Just in time) compiler RustPython has a **very** experimental JIT compiler that compile python functions into native code. #### Building By default the JIT compiler isn't enabled, it's enabled with the `jit` cargo feature. ```bash cargo run --features jit ``` This requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and clang to be installed. #### Using To compile a function, call `__jit__()` on it. ```python def foo(): a = 5 return 10 + a foo.__jit__() # this will compile foo to native code and subsequent calls will execute that native code assert foo() == 15 ``` ## Embedding RustPython into your Rust Applications Interested in exposing Python scripting in an application written in Rust, perhaps to allow quickly tweaking logic where Rust's compile times would be inhibitive? Then `examples/hello_embed.rs` and `examples/mini_repl.rs` may be of some assistance. ## Disclaimer RustPython is in development, and while the interpreter certainly can be used in interesting use cases like running Python in WASM and embedding into a Rust project, do note that RustPython is not totally production-ready. Contribution is more than welcome! See our contribution section for more information on this. ## Conference videos Checkout those talks on conferences: - [FOSDEM 2019]( - [EuroPython 2018]( ## Use cases Although RustPython is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to make cool projects: - [GreptimeDB]( an open-source, cloud-native, distributed time-series database. Using RustPython for embedded scripting. - [pyckitup]( a game engine written in rust. - [Robot Rumble]( an arena-based AI competition platform - [Ruff]( an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust ## Goals - Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings) - A clean implementation without compatibility hacks ## Documentation Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an early phase. You can read the [online documentation]( for the latest release, or the [user guide]( You can also generate documentation locally by running: ```shell cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies ``` Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory or you can append `--open` to the previous commands to have the documentation open automatically on your default browser. For a high level overview of the components, see the [architecture](architecture/architecture.md) document. ## Contributing Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide contributors through PRs or on Discord. Please refer to the [development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments. With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of the best ways to get started are below: Most tasks are listed in the [issue tracker]( Check issues labeled with [good first issue]( if you wish to start coding. To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: [How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest]( Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute. You can also simply run `./whats_left.py` to assist in finding any unimplemented method. ## Compiling to WebAssembly [See this doc](wasm/README.md) ## Community [][discord] Chat with us on [Discord][discord]. ## Code of conduct Our code of conduct [can be found here](code-of-conduct.md). ## Credit The initial work was based on [windelbouwman/rspython]( and [shinglyu/RustPython]( [discord]: ## Links These are some useful links to related projects: - - - ## License This project is licensed under the MIT license.

incubator-seata,apache/incubator-seata,24990,"['Java', 'ANTLR', 'TypeScript']","['tcc', 'saga', 'xa', 'at', 'consistency']","# Seata: Simple Extensible Autonomous Transaction Architecture []( []( []( []( ## What is Seata? A **distributed transaction solution** with high performance and ease of use for **microservices** architecture. ### Distributed Transaction Problem in Microservices Let's imagine a traditional monolithic application. Its business is built up with 3 modules. They use a single local data source. Naturally, data consistency will be guaranteed by the local transaction. Things have changed in a microservices architecture. The 3 modules mentioned above are designed to be 3 services on top of 3 different data sources ([Pattern: Database per service]( Data consistency within every single service is naturally guaranteed by the local transaction. **But how about the whole business logic scope?** ### How Seata do? Seata is just a solution to the problem mentioned above. Firstly, how to define a **Distributed Transaction**? We say, a **Distributed Transaction** is a **Global Transaction** which is made up with a batch of **Branch Transaction**, and normally **Branch Transaction** is just **Local Transaction**. There are three roles in Seata Framework: - **Transaction Coordinator(TC):** Maintain status of global and branch transactions, drive the global commit or rollback. - **Transaction Manager(TM):** Define the scope of global transaction: begin a global transaction, commit or rollback a global transaction. - **Resource Manager(RM):** Manage resources that branch transactions working on, talk to TC for registering branch transactions and reporting status of branch transactions, and drive the branch transaction commit or rollback. A typical lifecycle of Seata managed distributed transaction: 1. TM asks TC to begin a new global transaction. TC generates an XID representing the global transaction. 2. XID is propagated through microservices' invoke chain. 3. RM registers local transaction as a branch of the corresponding global transaction of XID to TC. 4. TM asks TC for committing or rollbacking the corresponding global transaction of XID. 5. TC drives all branch transactions under the corresponding global transaction of XID to finish branch committing or rollbacking. For more details about principle and design, please go to [Seata wiki page]( ### History ##### Alibaba - **TXC**: Taobao Transaction Constructor. Alibaba middleware team started this project since 2014 to meet the distributed transaction problems caused by application architecture change from monolithic to microservices. - **GTS**: Global Transaction Service. TXC as an Aliyun middleware product with new name GTS was published since 2016. - **Fescar**: we started the open source project Fescar based on TXC/GTS since 2019 to work closely with the community in the future. ##### Ant Financial - **XTS**: Extended Transaction Service. Ant Financial middleware team developed the distributed transaction middleware since 2007, which is widely used in Ant Financial and solves the problems of data consistency across databases and services. - **DTX**: Distributed Transaction Extended. Since 2013, XTS has been published on the Ant Financial Cloud, with the name of DTX . ##### Seata Community - **Seata** :Simple Extensible Autonomous Transaction Architecture. Ant Financial joins Fescar, which make it to be a more neutral and open community for distributed transaction, and Fescar be renamed to Seata. ## Maven dependency Depending on the scenario, choose one of the two dependencies: `io.seata:seata-all` or `io.seata:seata-spring-boot-starter`. ```xml 2.0.0 io.seata seata-all ${seata.version} io.seata seata-spring-boot-starter ${seata.version} ``` ## Quick Start [Quick Start]( ## Documentation You can view the full documentation from Seata Official Website: [Seata Website page]( ## Reporting bugs Please follow the [template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.md)for reporting any issues. ## Security Please do not use our public issue tracker but refer to our [security policy](./SECURITY.md) ## Contributing Contributors are welcomed to join the Seata project.

EventBus,greenrobot/EventBus,24599,"['Java', 'CSS']",[],"EventBus ======== [EventBus]( is a publish/subscribe event bus for Android and Java. []( []( EventBus... * simplifies the communication between components * decouples event senders and receivers * performs well with Activities, Fragments, and background threads * avoids complex and error-prone dependencies and life cycle issues * makes your code simpler * is fast * is tiny (~60k jar) * is proven in practice by apps with 1,000,000,000+ installs * has advanced features like delivery threads, subscriber priorities, etc. EventBus in 3 steps ------------------- 1. Define events: ```java public static class MessageEvent { /* Additional fields if needed */ } ``` 2. Prepare subscribers: Declare and annotate your subscribing method, optionally specify a [thread mode]( ```java @Subscribe(threadMode = ThreadMode.MAIN) public void onMessageEvent(MessageEvent event) { // Do something } ``` Register and unregister your subscriber. For example on Android, activities and fragments should usually register according to their life cycle: ```java @Override public void onStart() { super.onStart(); EventBus.getDefault().register(this); } @Override public void onStop() { super.onStop(); EventBus.getDefault().unregister(this); } ``` 3. Post events: ```java EventBus.getDefault().post(new MessageEvent()); ``` Read the full [getting started guide]( There are also some [examples]( **Note:** we highly recommend the [EventBus annotation processor with its subscriber index]( This will avoid some reflection related problems seen in the wild. Add EventBus to your project ---------------------------- Available on Maven Central. Android projects: ```groovy implementation(""org.greenrobot:eventbus:3.3.1"") ``` Java projects: ```groovy implementation(""org.greenrobot:eventbus-java:3.3.1"") ``` ```xml org.greenrobot eventbus-java 3.3.1 ``` R8, ProGuard ------------ If your project uses R8 or ProGuard this library ships [with embedded rules](/eventbus-android/consumer-rules.pro).

Hystrix,Netflix/Hystrix,23914,"['Java', 'Clojure', 'CSS']",[],"# Hystrix: Latency and Fault Tolerance for Distributed Systems []() [![][travis img]][travis] [![][maven img]][maven] [![][license img]][license] # Hystrix Status Hystrix is no longer in active development, and is currently in maintenance mode. Hystrix (at version 1.5.18) is stable enough to meet the needs of Netflix for our existing applications. Meanwhile, our focus has shifted towards more adaptive implementations that react to an applications real time performance rather than pre-configured settings (for example, through [adaptive concurrency limits]( For the cases where something like Hystrix makes sense, we intend to continue using Hystrix for existing applications, and to leverage open and active projects like [resilience4j]( for new internal projects. We are beginning to recommend others do the same. Netflix Hystrix is now officially in maintenance mode, with the following expectations to the greater community: Netflix will no longer actively review issues, merge pull-requests, and release new versions of Hystrix. We have made a final release of Hystrix (1.5.18) per [issue 1891]( so that the latest version in Maven Central is aligned with the last known stable version used internally at Netflix (1.5.11). If members of the community are interested in taking ownership of Hystrix and moving it back into active mode, please reach out to hystrixoss@googlegroups.com. Hystrix has served Netflix and the community well over the years, and the transition to maintenance mode is in no way an indication that the concepts and ideas from Hystrix are no longer valuable. On the contrary, Hystrix has inspired many great ideas and projects. We thank everyone at Netflix, and in the greater community, for all the contributions made to Hystrix over the years. ## Introduction Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable. ## Full Documentation See the [Wiki]( for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information. See the [Javadoc]( for the API. ## Communication - Google Group: [HystrixOSS]( - Twitter: [@HystrixOSS]( - [GitHub Issues]( ## What does it do? #### 1) Latency and Fault Tolerance Stop cascading failures. Fallbacks and graceful degradation. Fail fast and rapid recovery. Thread and semaphore isolation with circuit breakers. #### 2) Realtime Operations Realtime monitoring and configuration changes. Watch service and property changes take effect immediately as they spread across a fleet. Be alerted, make decisions, affect change and see results in seconds. #### 3) Concurrency Parallel execution. Concurrency aware request caching. Automated batching through request collapsing. ## Hello World! Code to be isolated is wrapped inside the run() method of a HystrixCommand similar to the following: ```java public class CommandHelloWorld extends HystrixCommand { private final String name; public CommandHelloWorld(String name) { super(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey(""ExampleGroup"")); this.name = name; } @Override protected String run() { return ""Hello "" + name + ""!""; } } ``` This command could be used like this: ```java String s = new CommandHelloWorld(""Bob"").execute(); Future s = new CommandHelloWorld(""Bob"").queue(); Observable s = new CommandHelloWorld(""Bob"").observe(); ``` More examples and information can be found in the [How To Use]( section. Example source code can be found in the [hystrix-examples]( module. ## Binaries Binaries and dependency information for Maven, Ivy, Gradle and others can be found at [ Change history and version numbers => [CHANGELOG.md]( Example for Maven: ```xml com.netflix.hystrix hystrix-core x.y.z ``` and for Ivy: ```xml ``` If you need to download the jars instead of using a build system, create a Maven pom file like this with the desired version: ```xml 4.0.0 com.netflix.hystrix.download hystrix-download 1.0-SNAPSHOT Simple POM to download hystrix-core and dependencies com.netflix.hystrix hystrix-core x.y.z ``` Then execute: ``` mvn -f download-hystrix-pom.xml dependency:copy-dependencies ``` It will download hystrix-core-*.jar and its dependencies into ./target/dependency/. You need Java 6 or later. ## Build To build: ``` $ git clone git@github.com:Netflix/Hystrix.git $ cd Hystrix/ $ ./gradlew build ``` Further details on building can be found on the [Getting Started]( page of the wiki. ## Run Demo To run a [demo app]( do the following: ``` $ git clone git@github.com:Netflix/Hystrix.git $ cd Hystrix/ ./gradlew runDemo ``` You will see output similar to the following: ``` Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][8ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][20ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][101ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1075ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS][2ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][22ms], GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][130ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1050ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS][4ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][19ms], GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][145ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1301ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][4ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][11ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][93ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1409ms] ##################################################################################### # CreditCardCommand: Requests: 17 Errors: 0 (0%) Mean: 1171 75th: 1391 90th: 1470 99th: 1486 # GetOrderCommand: Requests: 21 Errors: 0 (0%) Mean: 100 75th: 144 90th: 207 99th: 230 # GetUserAccountCommand: Requests: 21 Errors: 4 (19%) Mean: 8 75th: 11 90th: 46 99th: 51 # GetPaymentInformationCommand: Requests: 21 Errors: 0 (0%) Mean: 18 75th: 21 90th: 24 99th: 25 ##################################################################################### Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][10ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][16ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][51ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][922ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][12ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][12ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][68ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1257ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][10ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][11ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][78ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1295ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS][6ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][11ms], GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][153ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1321ms] ``` This demo simulates 4 different [HystrixCommand]( implementations with failures, latency, timeouts and duplicate calls in a multi-threaded environment.

Motrix,agalwood/Motrix,43668,"['JavaScript', 'Vue', 'SCSS']","['motrix', 'aria2', 'download-manager', 'macos', 'windows']","# Motrix ## A full-featured download manager []( English | [](./README-CN.md) Motrix is a full-featured download manager that supports downloading HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent, Magnet, etc. Motrix has a clean and easy to use interface. I hope you will like it . [Official Website]( | [Manual]( ## Installation Download from [GitHub Releases]( and install it. ### Windows It is recommended to install Motrix using the installation package (Motrix-Setup-x.y.z.exe) to ensure a complete experience, such as associating torrent files, capturing magnet links, etc. If you use package management tools to manage applications on Windows, such as [Chocolatey]( [scoop]( You can use them to install Motrix. #### Chocolatey Thanks to [@Yato]( for continuing to maintain the [Motrix Chocolatey]( package. To install motrix, run the following command from the `command line` or from `PowerShell`: ```bash # Install choco install motrix # Upgrade choco upgrade motrix ``` #### scoop If you prefer the portable version, you can use [scoop]( (need Windows 7+) to install Motrix. ```bash scoop bucket add extras scoop install motrix ``` ### macOS The macOS users can install Motrix using `brew`, thanks to [PR]( of [@Mitscherlich]( ```bash brew update && brew install motrix ``` #### Auto Update Since Motrix v1.8.0 and later versions changed the App BundleID ( `net.agalwood.Motrix` => `app.motrix.native` ), the automatic update of Motrix v1.6.11 will fail. [Motrix Install Assistant]( will help you install the latest Motrix application. ### Linux You can download the `AppImage` (for all Linux distributions) or `snap` to install Motrix, see [GitHub/release]( for more Linux installation package formats. Motrix may need to run with `sudo` for the first time in Linux because there is no permission to create the download session file (`/var/cache/aria2.session`). If you want to build from source code, please read the **Build** section. #### AppImage The latest version of Motrix AppImage requires you to manually perform desktop integration. Please check the documentation of [AppImageLauncher]( . > Desktop Integration > Since electron-builder 21 desktop integration is not a part of produced AppImage file. > [AppImageLauncher]( is the recommended way to integrate AppImages. Deepin 20 Beta users failed to install Motrix, please follow the steps below: Open the `Terminal`, paste and run the following command to install Motrix again. ```bash sudo apt --fix-broken install ``` #### Snap Motrix has been listed on [Snapcraft]( , Ubuntu users recommend downloading from the Snap Store. Tips for v1.5.10 The tray may not display the indicator normally, which makes it inconvenient to exit the application. Please unchecked Preferences--Basic Settings--Hide App Menu (Windows & Linux Only), click Save & Apply. Then click ""Exit"" in the File menu to exit the application. Please update to v1.5.12 and above, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + q to quickly exit the application. #### AUR For Arch Linux users, Motrix is available in [aur]( thanks to the maintainer [@weearc]( Run the following command to install: ```bash yay -S motrix ``` #### Flatpak Thanks to the [PR]( of [@proletarius101]( Motrix has been listed [Flathub]( Linux users who like the Flatpak can try it. ```bash # Install flatpak install flathub net.agalwood.Motrix # Run flatpak run net.agalwood.Motrix ``` ## Features - Simple and clear user interface - Supports BitTorrent & Magnet - BitTorrent selective download - Update tracker list every day automatically - UPnP & NAT-PMP Port Mapping - Up to 10 concurrent download tasks - Supports 64 threads in a single task - Supports speed limit - Mock User-Agent - Download completed Notification - Ready for Touch Bar (Mac only) - Resident system tray for quick operation - Tray speed meter displays real-time speed (Mac only) - Dark mode - Delete related files when removing tasks (optional) - I18n, [View supported languages](#-internationalization). - More features in development ## User Interface ## Development ### Clone Code ```bash git clone git@github.com:agalwood/Motrix.git ``` ### Install Dependencies ```bash cd Motrix yarn ``` > Error: Electron failed to install correctly, please delete node_modules/electron and try installing again `Electron` failed to install correctly, please refer to ### Dev Mode ```bash yarn run dev ``` ### Build Release ```bash yarn run build ``` #### Build for Apple Silicon ```bash yarn run build:applesilicon ``` After building, the application will be found in the project's `release` directory. ## Technology Stack - [Electron]( - [Vue]( + [VueX]( + [Element]( - [Aria2]( ## TODO Development Roadmap see: [Trello]( ## Contribute []( If you are interested in participating in joint development, PR and Forks are welcome! ## Internationalization Translations into versions for other languages are welcome !

It combines a great out-of-the-box development experience with a scalable architecture that can take your project from just getting started to massive production application. ## Features - **Zero config** Parcel supports many languages and file types out of the box, from web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to assets like images, fonts, videos, and more. It has a built-in dev server with hot reloading, beautiful error diagnostics, and much more. No configuration needed! - **Lightning fast** Parcel's JavaScript compiler is written in Rust for native performance. Your code is built in parallel using worker threads, utilizing all of the cores on your machine. Everything is cached, so you never build the same code twice. It's like using watch mode, but even when you restart Parcel! - **Automatic production optimization** Parcel optimizes your whole app for production automatically. This includes tree-shaking and minifying your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, resizing and optimizing images, content hashing, automatic code splitting, and much more. - **Ship for any target** Parcel automatically transforms your code for your target environments. From modern and legacy browser support, to zero config JSX and TypeScript compilation, Parcel makes it easy to build for any target or many! - **Scalable** Parcel requires zero configuration to get started. But as your application grows and your build requirements become more complex, it's possible to extend Parcel in just about every way. A simple configuration format and powerful plugin system that's designed from the ground up for performance means Parcel can support projects of any size. ## Getting Started See the following guides in our documentation on how to get started with Parcel. * [Building a webapp with Parcel]( * [Building a library with Parcel]( * [Migrating from Parcel v1]( ## Documentation Read the docs at ## Community - Ask questions on [GitHub Discussions]( - Join the community on [Discord]( - Stay up to date on new features and announcements on [Twitter]( ## Contributors This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.

In this challenge, you will learn everything you need to be a JavaScript programmer, and in general, the whole concept of programming. In the end of the challenge, you will get a 30DaysOfJavaScript programming challenge completion certificate. In case you need help or if you would like to help others you may join the dedicated [telegram group]( **A 30DaysOfJavaScript** challenge is a guide for both beginners and advanced JavaScript developers. Welcome to JavaScript. JavaScript is the language of the web. I enjoy using and teaching JavaScript and I hope you will do so too. In this step by step JavaScript challenge, you will learn JavaScript, the most popular programming language in the history of mankind. JavaScript is used **_to add interactivity to websites, to develop mobile apps, desktop applications, games_** and nowadays JavaScript can be used for **server-side programming**, **_machine learning_** and **_AI_**. **_JavaScript (JS)_** has increased in popularity in recent years and has been the leading programming language for last ten years and is the most used programming language on GitHub. This challenge is easy to read, written in conversational English, engaging, motivating and at the same time, it is very demanding. You need to allocate much time to finish this challenge. If you are a visual learner, you may get the video lesson on Washera YouTube channel. Subscribe the channel, comment and ask questions on YouTube vides and be proactive, the author will eventually notice you. The author likes to hear your opinion about the challenge, share the author by expressing your thoughts about the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge. You can leave your testimonial on this [link]( ## Requirements No prior knowledge of programming is required to follow this challenge. You need only: 1. Motivation 2. A computer 3. Internet 4. A browser 5. A code editor ## Setup I believe you have the motivation and a strong desire to be a developer, a computer and Internet. If you have those, then you have everything to get started. ### Install Node.js You may not need Node.js right now but you may need it for later. Install [node.js]( After downloading double click and install We can check if node is installed on our local machine by opening our device terminal or command prompt. ```sh asabeneh $ node -v v12.14.0 ``` When making this tutorial I was using Node version 12.14.0, but now the recommended version of Node.js for download is v14.17.6, by the time you use this material you may have a higher Node.js version. ### Browser There are many browsers out there. However, I strongly recommend Google Chrome. #### Installing Google Chrome Install [Google Chrome]( if you do not have one yet. We can write small JavaScript code on the browser console, but we do not use the browser console to develop applications. #### Opening Google Chrome Console You can open Google Chrome console either by clicking three dots at the top right corner of the browser, selecting _More tools -> Developer tools_ or using a keyboard shortcut. I prefer using shortcuts. To open the Chrome console using a keyboard shortcut. ```sh Mac Command+Option+J Windows/Linux: Ctl+Shift+J ``` After you open the Google Chrome console, try to explore the marked buttons. We will spend most of the time on the Console. The Console is the place where your JavaScript code goes. The Google Console V8 engine changes your JavaScript code to machine code. Let us write a JavaScript code on the Google Chrome console: #### Writing Code on Browser Console We can write any JavaScript code on the Google console or any browser console. However, for this challenge, we only focus on Google Chrome console. Open the console using: ```sh Mac Command+Option+I Windows: Ctl+Shift+I ``` ##### Console.log To write our first JavaScript code, we used a built-in function **console.log()**. We passed an argument as input data, and the function displays the output. We passed `'Hello, World'` as input data or argument in the console.log() function. ```js console.log('Hello, World!') ``` ##### Console.log with Multiple Arguments The **`console.log()`** function can take multiple parameters separated by commas. The syntax looks like as follows:**`console.log(param1, param2, param3)`** ```js console.log('Hello', 'World', '!') console.log('HAPPY', 'NEW', 'YEAR', 2020) console.log('Welcome', 'to', 30, 'Days', 'Of', 'JavaScript') ``` As you can see from the snippet code above, _`console.log()`_ can take multiple arguments. Congratulations! You wrote your first JavaScript code using _`console.log()`_. ##### Comments We can add comments to our code. Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this `//` is also a comment. **Example: Single Line Comment** ```js // This is the first comment // This is the second comment // I am a single line comment ``` **Example: Multiline Comment** ```js /* This is a multiline comment Multiline comments can take multiple lines JavaScript is the language of the web */ ``` ##### Syntax Programming languages are similar to human languages. English or many other language uses words, phrases, sentences, compound sentences and other more to convey a meaningful message. The English meaning of syntax is _the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language_. The technical definition of syntax is the structure of statements in a computer language. Programming languages have syntax. JavaScript is a programming language and like other programming languages it has its own syntax. If we do not write a syntax that JavaScript understands, it will raise different types of errors. We will explore different kinds of JavaScript errors later. For now, let us see syntax errors. I made a deliberate mistake. As a result, the console raises syntax errors. Actually, the syntax is very informative. It informs what type of mistake was made. By reading the error feedback guideline, we can correct the syntax and fix the problem. The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called debugging. Let us fix the errors: ```js console.log('Hello, World!') console.log('Hello, World!') ``` So far, we saw how to display text using the _`console.log()`_. If we are printing text or string using _`console.log()`_, the text has to be inside the single quotes, double quotes, or a backtick. **Example:** ```js console.log('Hello, World!') console.log(""Hello, World!"") console.log(`Hello, World!`) ``` #### Arithmetics Now, let us practice more writing JavaScript codes using _`console.log()`_ on Google Chrome console for number data types. In addition to the text, we can also do mathematical calculations using JavaScript. Let us do the following simple calculations. It is possible to write JavaScript code on Google Chrome console can directly without the **_`console.log()`_** function. However, it is included in this introduction because most of this challenge would be taking place in a text editor where the usage of the function would be mandatory. You can play around directly with instructions on the console. ```js console.log(2 + 3) // Addition console.log(3 - 2) // Subtraction console.log(2 * 3) // Multiplication console.log(3 / 2) // Division console.log(3 % 2) // Modulus - finding remainder console.log(3 ** 2) // Exponentiation 3 ** 2 == 3 * 3 ``` ### Code Editor We can write our codes on the browser console, but it won't be for bigger projects. In a real working environment, developers use different code editors to write their codes. In this 30 days of JavaScript challenge, we will be using Visual Studio Code. #### Installing Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code is a very popular open-source text editor. I would recommend to [download Visual Studio Code]( but if you are in favor of other editors, feel free to follow with what you have. If you installed Visual Studio Code, let us start using it. #### How to Use Visual Studio Code Open the Visual Studio Code by double-clicking its icon. When you open it, you will get this kind of interface. Try to interact with the labeled icons. ## Adding JavaScript to a Web Page JavaScript can be added to a web page in three different ways: - **_Inline script_** - **_Internal script_** - **_External script_** - **_Multiple External scripts_** The following sections show different ways of adding JavaScript code to your web page. ### Inline Script Create a project folder on your desktop or in any location, name it 30DaysOfJS and create an **_`index.html`_** file in the project folder. Then paste the following code and open it in a browser, for example [Chrome]( ```html 30DaysOfScript:Inline Script Click Me ``` Now, you just wrote your first inline script. We can create a pop up alert message using the _`alert()`_ built-in function. ### Internal Script The internal script can be written in the _`head`_ or the _`body`_, but it is preferred to put it on the body of the HTML document. First, let us write on the head part of the page. ```html 30DaysOfScript:Internal Script ``` This is how we write an internal script most of the time. Writing the JavaScript code in the body section is the most preferred option. Open the browser console to see the output from the `console.log()`. ```html 30DaysOfScript:Internal Script Click Me ``` Open the browser console to see the output from the `console.log()`. ### External Script Similar to the internal script, the external script link can be on the header or body, but it is preferred to put it in the body. First, we should create an external JavaScript file with .js extension. All files ending with .js extension are JavaScript files. Create a file named introduction.js inside your project directory and write the following code and link this .js file at the bottom of the body. ```js console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript') ``` External scripts in the _head_: ```html 30DaysOfJavaScript:External script ``` External scripts in the _body_: ```html 30DaysOfJavaScript:External script ``` Open the browser console to see the output of the `console.log()`. ### Multiple External Scripts We can also link multiple external JavaScript files to a web page. Create a `helloworld.js` file inside the 30DaysOfJS folder and write the following code. ```js console.log('Hello, World!') ``` ```html Multiple External Scripts ``` _Your main.js file should be below all other scripts_. It is very important to remember this. ## Introduction to Data types In JavaScript and also other programming languages, there are different types of data types. The following are JavaScript primitive data types: _String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null_, and _Symbol_. ### Numbers - Integers: Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ... - Float-point numbers: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ... ### Strings A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. **Example:** ```js 'a' 'Asabeneh' ""Asabeneh"" 'Finland' 'JavaScript is a beautiful programming language' 'I love teaching' 'I hope you are enjoying the first day' `We can also create a string using a backtick` 'A string could be just as small as one character or as big as many pages' 'Any data type under a single quote, double quote or backtick is a string' ``` ### Booleans A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false. A boolean data type is either a true or false value. **Example:** ```js true // if the light is on, the value is true false // if the light is off, the value is false ``` ### Undefined In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined. ```js let firstName console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet ``` ### Null Null in JavaScript means an empty value. ```js let emptyValue = null ``` ## Checking Data Types To check the data type of a certain variable, we use the **typeof** operator. See the following example. ```js console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh') // string console.log(typeof 5) // number console.log(typeof true) // boolean console.log(typeof null) // object type console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined ``` ## Comments Again Remember that commenting in JavaScript is similar to other programming languages. Comments are important in making your code more readable. There are two ways of commenting: - _Single line commenting_ - _Multiline commenting_ ```js // commenting the code itself with a single comment // let firstName = 'Asabeneh'; single line comment // let lastName = 'Yetayeh'; single line comment ``` Multiline commenting: ```js /* let location = 'Helsinki'; let age = 100; let isMarried = true; This is a Multiple line comment */ ``` ## Variables Variables are _containers_ of data. Variables are used to _store_ data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data. To declare a variable, we use _var_, _let_, or _const_ keywords. For a variable that changes at a different time, we use _let_. If the data does not change at all, we use _const_. For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use _const_. We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. It is error prone way of declaring variable it has lots of leak. We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). For now, the above explanation is enough. A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules: - A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number. - A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore. - A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention. - A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words. The following are examples of valid JavaScript variables. ```js firstName lastName country city capitalCity age isMarried first_name last_name is_married capital_city num1 num_1 _num_1 $num1 year2020 year_2020 ``` The first and second variables on the list follows the camelCase convention of declaring in JavaScript. In this material, we will use camelCase variables(camelWithOneHump). We use CamelCase(CamelWithTwoHump) to declare classes, we will discuss about classes and objects in other section. Example of invalid variables: ```js first-name 1_num num_#_1 ``` Let us declare variables with different data types. To declare a variable, we need to use _let_ or _const_ keyword before the variable name. Following the variable name, we write an equal sign (assignment operator), and a value(assigned data). ```js // Syntax let nameOfVariable = value ``` The nameOfVriable is the name that stores different data of value. See below for detail examples. **Examples of declared variables** ```js // Declaring different variables of different data types let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // first name of a person let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // last name of a person let country = 'Finland' // country let city = 'Helsinki' // capital city let age = 100 // age in years let isMarried = true console.log(firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried) ``` ```sh Asabeneh Yetayeh Finland Helsinki 100 true ``` ```js // Declaring variables with number values let age = 100 // age in years const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity in m/s2 const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in C const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant console.log(gravity, boilingPoint, PI) ``` ```sh 9.81 100 3.14 ``` ```js // Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble let name = 'Asabeneh', job = 'teacher', live = 'Finland' console.log(name, job, live) ``` ```sh Asabeneh teacher Finland ``` When you run _index.html_ file in the 01-Day folder you should get this: You are amazing! You have just completed day 1 challenge and you are on your way to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and muscle. # Day 1: Exercises 1.

As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:. :sparkles: See what's new in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md). **Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache]( plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and must be retained in the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll encounter `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build. [![Minimal Mistakes live preview][2]][1] [1]: [2]: screenshot.png (live preview) ## Notable features - Bundled as a ""theme gem"" for easier installation/upgrading. - Compatible with GitHub Pages. - Support for Jekyll's built-in Sass/SCSS preprocessor. - Nine different skins (color variations). - Several responsive layout options (single, archive index, search, splash, and paginated home page). - Optimized for search engines with support for [Twitter Cards]( and [Open Graph]( data. - Optional [header images]( [custom sidebars]( [table of contents]( [galleries]( related posts, [breadcrumb links]( [navigation lists]( and more. - Commenting support (powered by [Disqus]( [Facebook]( Google+, [Discourse]( static-based via [Staticman]( [utterances]( and [giscus]( - [Google Analytics]( support. - UI localized text in English (default), Arabic (), Brazilian Portuguese (Portugus brasileiro), Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French (Franais), German (Deutsch), Greek, Hebrew, Hindi (), Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish (Gaeilge), Italian (Italiano), Japanese, Kiswahili, Korean, Malayalam, Myanmar (Burmese), Nepali (Nepalese), Norwegian (Norsk), Persian (), Polish, Punjabi (), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish (Espaol), Swedish, Thai, Turkish (Trke), Ukrainian () and Vietnamese. ## Skins (color variations) This theme comes in nine different skins (in addition to the default one). | `air` | `contrast` | `dark` | | --- | --- | --- | | []( | []( | []( | | `dirt` | `mint` | `sunrise` | | --- | --- | --- | | []( | []( | []( | | `aqua` | `neon` | `plum` | | --- | --- | --- | | []( | []( | []( | ## Demo pages | Name | Description | | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | | [Post with Header Image][header-image-post] | A post with a large header image. | | [HTML Tags and Formatting Post][html-tags-post] | A variety of common markup showing how the theme styles them. | | [Syntax Highlighting Post][syntax-post] | Post displaying highlighted code. | | [Post with a Gallery][gallery-post] | A post showing several images wrapped in `` elements. | | [Sample Collection Page][sample-collection] | Single page from a collection. | | [Categories Archive][categories-archive] | Posts grouped by category. | | [Tags Archive][tags-archive] | Posts grouped by tag. | Additional sample posts are available under [posts archive][year-archive] on the demo site.

Yet all of the necessary directories will be read and processed during Jekylls build process. This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files. To install: 1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`: ```ruby gem ""minimal-mistakes-jekyll"" ``` 2. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler]( command: ```bash bundle ``` 3. Set the `theme` in your project's Jekyll `_config.yml` file: ```yaml theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll ``` To update the theme run `bundle update`. ### Remote theme method Remote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require `Gemfile` changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages. To install: 1. Create/replace the contents of your `Gemfile` with the following: ```ruby source "" gem ""github-pages"", group: :jekyll_plugins gem ""jekyll-include-cache"", group: :jekyll_plugins ``` 2. Add `jekyll-include-cache` to the `plugins` array of your `_config.yml`. 3. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler]( command: ```bash bundle ``` 4. Add `remote_theme: ""mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.26.1""` to your `_config.yml` file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entry. **Looking for an example?** Use the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter]( for the quickest method of getting a GitHub Pages hosted site up and running. Generate a new repository from the starter, replace sample content with your own, and configure as needed. ## Usage For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add/migrate content, and more read the [theme's documentation]( ## Contributing Found a typo in the documentation or interested in [fixing a bug]( Then by all means [submit an issue]( or [pull request]( If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow]( first. For help with using the theme or general Jekyll support questions, please use the [Jekyll Talk forums]( ### Pull Requests When submitting a pull request: 1. Clone the repo. 2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`). 3. Open a pull request on GitHub and describe the feature or fix. Theme documentation and demo pages can be found in the [`/docs`](docs) if submitting improvements, typo corrections, etc. ## Development To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`. To test the theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at ` This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh. ## Credits ### Creator **Michael Rose** - - - ### Icons + Demo Images: - [The Noun Project]( - Garrett Knoll, Arthur Shlain, and [tracy tam]( - [Font Awesome]( - [Unsplash]( ### Other: - [Jekyll]( - [jQuery]( - [Susy]( - [Breakpoint]( - [Magnific Popup]( - [FitVids.JS]( - [GreedyNav.js]( - [Smooth Scroll]( - [Gumshoe]( - [jQuery throttle / debounce]( - [Lunr]( - [Clipboard.js]( ## License The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2013-2024 Michael Rose and contributors Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

go-zero,zeromicro/go-zero,27835,"['Go', 'Smarty', 'ANTLR']","['golang', 'microservice', 'rpc-framework', 'web-framework', 'gozero']","# go-zero go-zero is a web and rpc framework with lots of builtin engineering practices. Its born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design and has been serving sites with tens of millions of users for years. []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( ## What is go-zero? English | [](readme-cn.md) go-zero (listed in CNCF Landscape: [ is a web and rpc framework with lots of builtin engineering practices. Its born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design and has been serving sites with tens of millions of users for years. go-zero contains simple API description syntax and code generation tool called `goctl`. You can generate Go, iOS, Android, Kotlin, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript from .api files with `goctl`. #### Advantages of go-zero: * Improves the stability of the services with tens of millions of daily active users * Builtin chained timeout control, concurrency control, rate limit, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, even no configuration needed * Builtin middlewares also can be integrated into your frameworks * Simple API syntax, one command to generate a couple of different languages * Auto validate the request parameters from clients * Plenty of builtin microservice management and concurrent toolkits ## Backgrounds of go-zero At the beginning of 2018, we decided to re-design our system, from monolithic architecture with Java+MongoDB to microservice architecture. After research and comparison, we chose to: In early 2018, we embarked on a transformative journey to redesign our system, transitioning from a monolithic architecture built with Java and MongoDB to a microservices architecture. After careful research and comparison, we made a deliberate choice to: * Go Beyond with Golang * Great performance * Simple syntax * Proven engineering efficiency * Extreme deployment experience * Less server resource consumption * Self-Design Our Microservice Architecture * Microservice architecture facilitates the creation of scalable, flexible, and maintainable software systems with independent, reusable components. * Easy to locate the problems within microservices. * Easy to extend the features by adding or modifying specific microservices without impacting the entire system. ## Design considerations on go-zero By designing the microservice architecture, we expected to ensure stability, as well as productivity. And from just the beginning, we have the following design principles: * Keep it simple * High availability * Stable on high concurrency * Easy to extend * Resilience design, failure-oriented programming * Try best to be friendly to the business logic development, encapsulate the complexity * One thing, one way After almost half a year, we finished the transfer from a monolithic system to microservice system and deployed on August 2018. The new system guaranteed business growth and system stability. ## The implementation and features of go-zero go-zero is a web and rpc framework that integrates lots of engineering practices. The features are mainly listed below: * Powerful tool included, less code to write * Simple interfaces * Fully compatible with net/http * Middlewares are supported, easy to extend * High performance * Failure-oriented programming, resilience design * Builtin service discovery, load balancing * Builtin concurrency control, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, auto-trigger, auto recover * Auto validation of API request parameters * Chained timeout control * Auto management of data caching * Call tracing, metrics, and monitoring * High concurrency protected As below, go-zero protects the system with a couple of layers and mechanisms: ## The simplified architecture that we use with go-zero ## Installation Run the following command under your project: ```shell go get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero ``` ## Quick Start 1. Full examples can be checked out from below: [Rapid development of microservice systems]( [Rapid development of microservice systems - multiple RPCs]( 2. Install goctl `goctl`can be read as `go control`. `goctl` means not to be controlled by code, instead, we control it. The inside `go` is not `golang`. At the very beginning, I was expecting it to help us improve productivity, and make our lives easier. ```shell # for Go go install github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl@latest # For Mac brew install goctl # docker for amd64 architecture docker pull kevinwan/goctl # run goctl like docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/app kevinwan/goctl --help # docker for arm64(Mac) architecture docker pull kevinwan/goctl:latest-arm64 # run goctl like docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/app kevinwan/goctl:latest-arm64 --help ``` make sure goctl is executable. 3. Create the API file, like greet.api, you can install the plugin of goctl in vs code, api syntax is supported. ```go type ( Request { Name string `path:""name,options=[you,me]""` // parameters are auto validated } Response { Message string `json:""message""` } ) service greet-api { @handler GreetHandler get /greet/from/:name(Request) returns (Response) } ``` the .api files also can be generated by goctl, like below: ```shell goctl api -o greet.api ``` 4. Generate the go server-side code ```shell goctl api go -api greet.api -dir greet ``` the generated files look like: ```Plain Text greet etc greet-api.yaml // configuration file greet.go // main file internal config config.go // configuration definition handler greethandler.go // get/put/post/delete routes are defined here routes.go // routes list logic greetlogic.go // request logic can be written here svc servicecontext.go // service context, mysql/redis can be passed in here types types.go // request/response defined here greet.api // api description file ``` the generated code can be run directly: ```shell cd greet go mod init go mod tidy go run greet.go -f etc/greet-api.yaml ``` by default, its listening on port 8888, while it can be changed in the configuration file. you can check it by curl: ```shell curl -i ``` the response looks like below: ```http HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 30 Aug 2020 15:32:35 GMT Content-Length: 0 ``` 5. Write the business logic code * the dependencies can be passed into the logic within servicecontext.go, like mysql, redis, etc. * add the logic code in a logic package according to .api file 6. Generate code like Java, TypeScript, Dart, JavaScript, etc. just from the api file ```shell goctl api java -api greet.api -dir greet goctl api dart -api greet.api -dir greet ... ``` ## Benchmark [Checkout the test code]( ## Documents * [Documents]( * [Rapid development of microservice systems]( * [Rapid development of microservice systems - multiple RPCs]( * [Examples]( ## Chat group Join the chat via ## Cloud Native Landscape go-zero enlisted in the [CNCF Cloud Native Landscape]( ## Give a Star!

It wraps Kubernetes and other components in a single, simple launcher. 1. It is secure by default with reasonable defaults for lightweight environments. 1. It has minimal to no OS dependencies (just a sane kernel and cgroup mounts needed). 1. It eliminates the need to expose a port on Kubernetes worker nodes for the kubelet API by exposing this API to the Kubernetes control plane nodes over a websocket tunnel. K3s bundles the following technologies together into a single cohesive distribution: * [Containerd]( & [runc]( * [Flannel]( for CNI * [CoreDNS]( * [Metrics Server]( * [Traefik]( for ingress * [Klipper-lb]( as an embedded service load balancer provider * [Kube-router]( netpol controller for network policy * [Helm-controller]( to allow for CRD-driven deployment of helm manifests * [Kine]( as a datastore shim that allows etcd to be replaced with other databases * [Local-path-provisioner]( for provisioning volumes using local storage * [Host utilities]( such as iptables/nftables, ebtables, ethtool, & socat These technologies can be disabled or swapped out for technologies of your choice. Additionally, K3s simplifies Kubernetes operations by maintaining functionality for: * Managing the TLS certificates of Kubernetes components * Managing the connection between worker and server nodes * Auto-deploying Kubernetes resources from local manifests in realtime as they are changed. * Managing an embedded etcd cluster Current Status -------------- []( []( []( []( What's with the name? -------------------- We wanted an installation of Kubernetes that was half the size in terms of memory footprint. Kubernetes is a 10 letter word stylized as k8s. So something half as big as Kubernetes would be a 5 letter word stylized as K3s. There is neither a long-form of K3s nor official pronunciation. Is this a fork? --------------- No, it's a distribution. A fork implies continued divergence from the original. This is not K3s's goal or practice. K3s explicitly intends not to change any core Kubernetes functionality. We seek to remain as close to upstream Kubernetes as possible. However, we maintain a small set of patches (well under 1000 lines) important to K3s's use case and deployment model. We maintain patches for other components as well. When possible, we contribute these changes back to the upstream projects, for example, with [SELinux support in containerd]( This is a common practice amongst software distributions. K3s is a distribution because it packages additional components and services necessary for a fully functional cluster that go beyond vanilla Kubernetes. These are opinionated choices on technologies for components like ingress, storage class, network policy, service load balancer, and even container runtime. These choices and technologies are touched on in more detail in the [What is this?](#what-is-this) section. How is this lightweight or smaller than upstream Kubernetes? --- There are two major ways that K3s is lighter weight than upstream Kubernetes: 1. The memory footprint to run it is smaller 2. The binary, which contains all the non-containerized components needed to run a cluster, is smaller The memory footprint is reduced primarily by running many components inside of a single process. This eliminates significant overhead that would otherwise be duplicated for each component. The binary is smaller by removing third-party storage drivers and cloud providers, explained in more detail below. What have you removed from upstream Kubernetes? --- This is a common point of confusion because it has changed over time. Early versions of K3s had much more removed than the current version. K3s currently removes two things: 1. In-tree storage drivers 1. In-tree cloud provider Both of these have out-of-tree alternatives in the form of [CSI]( and [CCM]( which work in K3s and which upstream is moving towards. We remove these to achieve a smaller binary size. They can be removed while remaining conformant because neither affects core Kubernetes functionality. They are also dependent on third-party cloud or data center technologies/services, which may not be available in many K3s' use cases. What's next? --- Check out our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what we have planned moving forward. Release cadence --- K3s maintains pace with upstream Kubernetes releases. Our goal is to release patch releases within one week, and new minors within 30 days. Our release versioning reflects the version of upstream Kubernetes that is being released. For example, the K3s release [v1.27.4+k3s1]( maps to the `v1.27.4` Kubernetes release. We add a postfix in the form of `+k3s` to allow us to make additional releases using the same version of upstream Kubernetes while remaining [semver]( compliant. For example, if we discovered a high severity bug in `v1.27.4+k3s1` and needed to release an immediate fix for it, we would release `v1.27.4+k3s2`. Documentation ------------- Please see [the official docs site]( for complete documentation. Quick-Start - Install Script -------------- The `install.sh` script provides a convenient way to download K3s and add a service to systemd or openrc. To install k3s as a service, run: ```bash curl -sfL | sh - ``` A kubeconfig file is written to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` and the service is automatically started or restarted. The install script will install K3s and additional utilities, such as `kubectl`, `crictl`, `k3s-killall.sh`, and `k3s-uninstall.sh`, for example: ```bash sudo kubectl get nodes ``` `K3S_TOKEN` is created at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` on your server. To install on worker nodes, pass `K3S_URL` along with `K3S_TOKEN` environment variables, for example: ```bash curl -sfL | K3S_URL= K3S_TOKEN=XXX sh - ``` Manual Download --------------- 1. Download `k3s` from latest [release]( x86_64, armhf, arm64 and s390x are supported. 1. Run the server. ```bash sudo k3s server & # Kubeconfig is written to /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml sudo k3s kubectl get nodes # On a different node run the below. NODE_TOKEN comes from # /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on your server sudo k3s agent --server --token ${NODE_TOKEN} ``` Contributing ------------ Please check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in contributing to K3s.

croc,schollz/croc,26545,"['Go', 'Shell', 'Makefile']","['file-sharing', 'tcp', 'golang', 'peer-to-peer', 'data-transfer']","This project is supported by Github sponsors. `croc` is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, *croc* is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following: - allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay) - provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE) - enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac) - allows **multiple file** transfers - allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted - local server or port-forwarding **not needed** - **ipv6-first** with ipv4 fallback - can **use proxy**, like tor For more information about `croc`, see [my blog post]( or read a [recent interview I did]( ## Install Download [the latest release for your system]( or install a release from the command-line: ``` curl | bash ``` On macOS you can install the latest release with [Homebrew]( ``` brew install croc ``` On macOS you can also install the latest release with [MacPorts]( ``` sudo port selfupdate sudo port install croc ``` On Windows you can install the latest release with [Scoop]( [Chocolatey]( or [Winget]( ``` scoop install croc ``` ``` choco install croc ``` ``` winget install schollz.croc ``` On Unix you can install the latest release with [Nix]( ``` nix-env -i croc ``` On Alpine Linux you have to install dependencies first: ``` apk add bash coreutils wget -qO- | bash ``` On Arch Linux you can install the latest release with `pacman`: ``` pacman -S croc ``` On Fedora you can install with `dnf`: ``` dnf install croc ``` On Gentoo you can install with `portage`: ``` emerge net-misc/croc ``` On Termux you can install with `pkg`: ``` pkg install croc ``` On FreeBSD you can install with `pkg`: ``` pkg install croc ``` Or, you can [install Go]( and build from source (requires Go 1.17+): ``` go install github.com/schollz/croc/v10@latest ``` On Android there is a 3rd party F-Droid app [available to download]( ## Usage To send a file, simply do: ``` $ croc send [file(s)-or-folder] Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB) Code is: code-phrase ``` Then to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do ``` croc code-phrase ``` The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement ([PAKE]( which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption. There are a number of configurable options (see `--help`). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using `--remember`. ### Custom code phrase You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters). ``` croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder] ``` ### Allow overwriting without prompt By default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the `--overwrite` flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite: ``` croc --yes --overwrite ``` ### Use pipes - stdin and stdout You can pipe to `croc`: ``` cat [filename] | croc send ``` In this case `croc` will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like ""croc-stdin-123456789"". To receive to `stdout` at you can always just use the `--yes` will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to `stdout`. ``` croc --yes [code-phrase] > out ``` All of the other text printed to the console is going to `stderr` so it will not interfere with the message going to `stdout`. ### Send text Sometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with `croc`: ``` croc send --text ""hello world"" ``` This will automatically tell the receiver to use `stdout` when they receive the text so it will be displayed. ### Use a proxy You can use a proxy as your connection to the relay by adding a proxy address with `--socks5`. For example, you can send via a tor relay: ``` croc --socks5 ""127.0.0.1:9050"" send SOMEFILE ``` ### Change encryption curve You can choose from several different elliptic curves to use for encryption by using the `--curve` flag. Only the recipient can choose the curve. For example, receive a file using the P-521 curve: ``` croc --curve p521 ``` Available curves are P-256, P-348, P-521 and SIEC. P-256 is the default curve. ### Change hash algorithm You can choose from several different hash algorithms. The default is the `xxhash` algorithm which is fast and thorough. If you want to optimize for speed you can use the `imohash` algorithm which is even faster, but since it samples files (versus reading the whole file) it can mistakenly determine that a file is the same on the two computers transferring - though this is only a problem if you are syncing files versus sending a new file to a computer. ``` croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE ``` ### Self-host relay The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. By default, `croc` uses a public relay but you can also run your own relay: ``` croc relay ``` By default it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. Make sure to open those up. You can customize the ports (e.g. `croc relay --ports 1111,1112`), but you must have a minimum of **2** ports for the relay. The first port is for communication and the subsequent ports are used for the multiplexed data transfer. You can send files using your relay by entering `--relay` to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own. ``` croc --relay ""myrelay.example.com:9009"" send [filename] ``` Note, when sending, you only need to include the first port (the communication port). The subsequent ports for data transfer will be transmitted back to the user from the relay. #### Self-host relay (docker) If it's easier you can also run a relay with Docker: ``` docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc ``` Be sure to include the password for the relay otherwise any requests will be rejected. ``` croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay ""myreal.example.com:9009"" send [filename] ``` Note: when including `--pass YOURPASSWORD` you can instead pass a file with the password, e.g. `--pass FILEWITHPASSWORD`. ## License MIT ## Acknowledgements `croc` has gone through many iterations, and I am awed by all the great contributions!

Share your thoughts here: > > **Thank you!** []( []( []( []( []( []( **Go configuration with fangs!** Many Go projects are built using Viper including: * [Hugo]( * [EMC RexRay]( * [Imgurs Incus]( * [Nanobox]( * [Docker Notary]( * [BloomApi]( * [doctl]( * [Clairctl]( * [Mercure]( * [Meshery]( * [Bearer]( * [Coder]( * [Vitess]( ## Install ```shell go get github.com/spf13/viper ``` **Note:** Viper uses [Go Modules]( to manage dependencies. ## What is Viper? Viper is a complete configuration solution for Go applications including [12-Factor apps]( It is designed to work within an application, and can handle all types of configuration needs and formats. It supports: * setting defaults * reading from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile and Java properties config files * live watching and re-reading of config files (optional) * reading from environment variables * reading from remote config systems (etcd or Consul), and watching changes * reading from command line flags * reading from buffer * setting explicit values Viper can be thought of as a registry for all of your applications configuration needs. ## Why Viper? When building a modern application, you dont want to worry about configuration file formats; you want to focus on building awesome software. Viper is here to help with that. Viper does the following for you: 1. Find, load, and unmarshal a configuration file in JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile or Java properties formats. 2. Provide a mechanism to set default values for your different configuration options. 3. Provide a mechanism to set override values for options specified through command line flags. 4. Provide an alias system to easily rename parameters without breaking existing code. 5. Make it easy to tell the difference between when a user has provided a command line or config file which is the same as the default. Viper uses the following precedence order. Each item takes precedence over the item below it: * explicit call to `Set` * flag * env * config * key/value store * default **Important:** Viper configuration keys are case insensitive. There are ongoing discussions about making that optional. ## Putting Values into Viper ### Establishing Defaults A good configuration system will support default values. A default value is not required for a key, but its useful in the event that a key hasn't been set via config file, environment variable, remote configuration or flag. Examples: ```go viper.SetDefault(""ContentDir"", ""content"") viper.SetDefault(""LayoutDir"", ""layouts"") viper.SetDefault(""Taxonomies"", map[string]string{""tag"": ""tags"", ""category"": ""categories""}) ``` ### Reading Config Files Viper requires minimal configuration so it knows where to look for config files. Viper supports JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile and Java Properties files. Viper can search multiple paths, but currently a single Viper instance only supports a single configuration file. Viper does not default to any configuration search paths leaving defaults decision to an application. Here is an example of how to use Viper to search for and read a configuration file. None of the specific paths are required, but at least one path should be provided where a configuration file is expected. ```go viper.SetConfigName(""config"") // name of config file (without extension) viper.SetConfigType(""yaml"") // REQUIRED if the config file does not have the extension in the name viper.AddConfigPath(""/etc/appname/"") // path to look for the config file in viper.AddConfigPath(""$HOME/.appname"") // call multiple times to add many search paths viper.AddConfigPath(""."") // optionally look for config in the working directory err := viper.ReadInConfig() // Find and read the config file if err != nil { // Handle errors reading the config file panic(fmt.Errorf(""fatal error config file: %w"", err)) } ``` You can handle the specific case where no config file is found like this: ```go if err := viper.ReadInConfig(); err != nil { if _, ok := err.(viper.ConfigFileNotFoundError); ok { // Config file not found; ignore error if desired } else { // Config file was found but another error was produced } } // Config file found and successfully parsed ``` *NOTE [since 1.6]:* You can also have a file without an extension and specify the format programmatically. For those configuration files that lie in the home of the user without any extension like `.bashrc` ### Writing Config Files Reading from config files is useful, but at times you want to store all modifications made at run time. For that, a bunch of commands are available, each with its own purpose: * WriteConfig - writes the current viper configuration to the predefined path, if exists. Errors if no predefined path. Will overwrite the current config file, if it exists. * SafeWriteConfig - writes the current viper configuration to the predefined path. Errors if no predefined path. Will not overwrite the current config file, if it exists. * WriteConfigAs - writes the current viper configuration to the given filepath. Will overwrite the given file, if it exists. * SafeWriteConfigAs - writes the current viper configuration to the given filepath. Will not overwrite the given file, if it exists. As a rule of the thumb, everything marked with safe won't overwrite any file, but just create if not existent, whilst the default behavior is to create or truncate. A small examples section: ```go viper.WriteConfig() // writes current config to predefined path set by 'viper.AddConfigPath()' and 'viper.SetConfigName' viper.SafeWriteConfig() viper.WriteConfigAs(""/path/to/my/.config"") viper.SafeWriteConfigAs(""/path/to/my/.config"") // will error since it has already been written viper.SafeWriteConfigAs(""/path/to/my/.other_config"") ``` ### Watching and re-reading config files Viper supports the ability to have your application live read a config file while running. Gone are the days of needing to restart a server to have a config take effect, viper powered applications can read an update to a config file while running and not miss a beat. Simply tell the viper instance to watchConfig. Optionally you can provide a function for Viper to run each time a change occurs. **Make sure you add all of the configPaths prior to calling `WatchConfig()`** ```go viper.OnConfigChange(func(e fsnotify.Event) { fmt.Println(""Config file changed:"", e.Name) }) viper.WatchConfig() ``` ### Reading Config from io.Reader Viper predefines many configuration sources such as files, environment variables, flags, and remote K/V store, but you are not bound to them. You can also implement your own required configuration source and feed it to viper. ```go viper.SetConfigType(""yaml"") // or viper.SetConfigType(""YAML"") // any approach to require this configuration into your program. var yamlExample = []byte(` Hacker: true name: steve hobbies: - skateboarding - snowboarding - go clothing: jacket: leather trousers: denim age: 35 eyes : brown beard: true `) viper.ReadConfig(bytes.NewBuffer(yamlExample)) viper.Get(""name"") // this would be ""steve"" ``` ### Setting Overrides These could be from a command line flag, or from your own application logic. ```go viper.Set(""Verbose"", true) viper.Set(""LogFile"", LogFile) viper.Set(""host.port"", 5899) // set subset ``` ### Registering and Using Aliases Aliases permit a single value to be referenced by multiple keys ```go viper.RegisterAlias(""loud"", ""Verbose"") viper.Set(""verbose"", true) // same result as next line viper.Set(""loud"", true) // same result as prior line viper.GetBool(""loud"") // true viper.GetBool(""verbose"") // true ``` ### Working with Environment Variables Viper has full support for environment variables. This enables 12 factor applications out of the box. There are five methods that exist to aid working with ENV: * `AutomaticEnv()` * `BindEnv(string...) : error` * `SetEnvPrefix(string)` * `SetEnvKeyReplacer(string...) *strings.Replacer` * `AllowEmptyEnv(bool)` _When working with ENV variables, its important to recognize that Viper treats ENV variables as case sensitive._ Viper provides a mechanism to try to ensure that ENV variables are unique. By using `SetEnvPrefix`, you can tell Viper to use a prefix while reading from the environment variables. Both `BindEnv` and `AutomaticEnv` will use this prefix. `BindEnv` takes one or more parameters. The first parameter is the key name, the rest are the name of the environment variables to bind to this key. If more than one are provided, they will take precedence in the specified order. The name of the environment variable is case sensitive. If the ENV variable name is not provided, then Viper will automatically assume that the ENV variable matches the following format: prefix + ""_"" + the key name in ALL CAPS. When you explicitly provide the ENV variable name (the second parameter), it **does not** automatically add the prefix. For example if the second parameter is ""id"", Viper will look for the ENV variable ""ID"". One important thing to recognize when working with ENV variables is that the value will be read each time it is accessed. Viper does not fix the value when the `BindEnv` is called. `AutomaticEnv` is a powerful helper especially when combined with `SetEnvPrefix`. When called, Viper will check for an environment variable any time a `viper.Get` request is made. It will apply the following rules. It will check for an environment variable with a name matching the key uppercased and prefixed with the `EnvPrefix` if set. `SetEnvKeyReplacer` allows you to use a `strings.Replacer` object to rewrite Env keys to an extent. This is useful if you want to use `-` or something in your `Get()` calls, but want your environmental variables to use `_` delimiters. An example of using it can be found in `viper_test.go`. Alternatively, you can use `EnvKeyReplacer` with `NewWithOptions` factory function. Unlike `SetEnvKeyReplacer`, it accepts a `StringReplacer` interface allowing you to write custom string replacing logic. By default empty environment variables are considered unset and will fall back to the next configuration source. To treat empty environment variables as set, use the `AllowEmptyEnv` method. #### Env example ```go SetEnvPrefix(""spf"") // will be uppercased automatically BindEnv(""id"") os.Setenv(""SPF_ID"", ""13"") // typically done outside of the app id := Get(""id"") // 13 ``` ### Working with Flags Viper has the ability to bind to flags. Specifically, Viper supports `Pflags` as used in the [Cobra]( library. Like `BindEnv`, the value is not set when the binding method is called, but when it is accessed. This means you can bind as early as you want, even in an `init()` function. For individual flags, the `BindPFlag()` method provides this functionality. Example: ```go serverCmd.Flags().Int(""port"", 1138, ""Port to run Application server on"") viper.BindPFlag(""port"", serverCmd.Flags().Lookup(""port"")) ``` You can also bind an existing set of pflags (pflag.FlagSet): Example: ```go pflag.Int(""flagname"", 1234, ""help message for flagname"") pflag.Parse() viper.BindPFlags(pflag.CommandLine) i := viper.GetInt(""flagname"") // retrieve values from viper instead of pflag ``` The use of [pflag]( in Viper does not preclude the use of other packages that use the [flag]( package from the standard library. The pflag package can handle the flags defined for the flag package by importing these flags. This is accomplished by a calling a convenience function provided by the pflag package called AddGoFlagSet(). Example: ```go package main import ( ""flag"" ""github.com/spf13/pflag"" ) func main() { // using standard library ""flag"" package flag.Int(""flagname"", 1234, ""help message for flagname"") pflag.CommandLine.AddGoFlagSet(flag.CommandLine) pflag.Parse() viper.BindPFlags(pflag.CommandLine) i := viper.GetInt(""flagname"") // retrieve value from viper // ... } ``` #### Flag interfaces Viper provides two Go interfaces to bind other flag systems if you dont use `Pflags`. `FlagValue` represents a single flag. This is a very simple example on how to implement this interface: ```go type myFlag struct {} func (f myFlag) HasChanged() bool { return false } func (f myFlag) Name() string { return ""my-flag-name"" } func (f myFlag) ValueString() string { return ""my-flag-value"" } func (f myFlag) ValueType() string { return ""string"" } ``` Once your flag implements this interface, you can simply tell Viper to bind it: ```go viper.BindFlagValue(""my-flag-name"", myFlag{}) ``` `FlagValueSet` represents a group of flags. This is a very simple example on how to implement this interface: ```go type myFlagSet struct { flags []myFlag } func (f myFlagSet) VisitAll(fn func(FlagValue)) { for _, flag := range flags { fn(flag) } } ``` Once your flag set implements this interface, you can simply tell Viper to bind it: ```go fSet := myFlagSet{ flags: []myFlag{myFlag{}, myFlag{}}, } viper.BindFlagValues(""my-flags"", fSet) ``` ### Remote Key/Value Store Support To enable remote support in Viper, do a blank import of the `viper/remote` package: `import _ ""github.com/spf13/viper/remote""` Viper will read a config string (as JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL or envfile) retrieved from a path in a Key/Value store such as etcd or Consul. These values take precedence over default values, but are overridden by configuration values retrieved from disk, flags, or environment variables. Viper supports multiple hosts. To use, pass a list of endpoints separated by `;`. For example ` Viper uses [crypt]( to retrieve configuration from the K/V store, which means that you can store your configuration values encrypted and have them automatically decrypted if you have the correct gpg keyring. Encryption is optional. You can use remote configuration in conjunction with local configuration, or independently of it. `crypt` has a command-line helper that you can use to put configurations in your K/V store. `crypt` defaults to etcd on ```bash $ go get github.com/bketelsen/crypt/bin/crypt $ crypt set -plaintext /config/hugo.json /Users/hugo/settings/config.json ``` Confirm that your value was set: ```bash $ crypt get -plaintext /config/hugo.json ``` See the `crypt` documentation for examples of how to set encrypted values, or how to use Consul. ### Remote Key/Value Store Example - Unencrypted #### etcd ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""etcd"", "" viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` #### etcd3 ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""etcd3"", "" viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` #### Consul You need to set a key to Consul key/value storage with JSON value containing your desired config. For example, create a Consul key/value store key `MY_CONSUL_KEY` with value: ```json { ""port"": 8080, ""hostname"": ""myhostname.com"" } ``` ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""consul"", ""localhost:8500"", ""MY_CONSUL_KEY"") viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // Need to explicitly set this to json err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() fmt.Println(viper.Get(""port"")) // 8080 fmt.Println(viper.Get(""hostname"")) // myhostname.com ``` #### Firestore ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""firestore"", ""google-cloud-project-id"", ""collection/document"") viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // Config's format: ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` Of course, you're allowed to use `SecureRemoteProvider` also #### NATS ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""nats"", ""nats://127.0.0.1:4222"", ""myapp.config"") viper.SetConfigType(""json"") err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` ### Remote Key/Value Store Example - Encrypted ```go viper.AddSecureRemoteProvider(""etcd"","" viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` ### Watching Changes in etcd - Unencrypted ```go // alternatively, you can create a new viper instance. var runtime_viper = viper.New() runtime_viper.AddRemoteProvider(""etcd"", "" ""/config/hugo.yml"") runtime_viper.SetConfigType(""yaml"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" // read from remote config the first time. err := runtime_viper.ReadRemoteConfig() // unmarshal config runtime_viper.Unmarshal(&runtime_conf) // open a goroutine to watch remote changes forever go func(){ for { time.Sleep(time.Second * 5) // delay after each request // currently, only tested with etcd support err := runtime_viper.WatchRemoteConfig() if err != nil { log.Errorf(""unable to read remote config: %v"", err) continue } // unmarshal new config into our runtime config struct. you can also use channel // to implement a signal to notify the system of the changes runtime_viper.Unmarshal(&runtime_conf) } }() ``` ## Getting Values From Viper In Viper, there are a few ways to get a value depending on the values type. The following functions and methods exist: * `Get(key string) : any` * `GetBool(key string) : bool` * `GetFloat64(key string) : float64` * `GetInt(key string) : int` * `GetIntSlice(key string) : []int` * `GetString(key string) : string` * `GetStringMap(key string) : map[string]any` * `GetStringMapString(key string) : map[string]string` * `GetStringSlice(key string) : []string` * `GetTime(key string) : time.Time` * `GetDuration(key string) : time.Duration` * `IsSet(key string) : bool` * `AllSettings() : map[string]any` One important thing to recognize is that each Get function will return a zero value if its not found. To check if a given key exists, the `IsSet()` method has been provided. The zero value will also be returned if the value is set, but fails to parse as the requested type. Example: ```go viper.GetString(""logfile"") // case-insensitive Setting & Getting if viper.GetBool(""verbose"") { fmt.Println(""verbose enabled"") } ``` ### Accessing nested keys The accessor methods also accept formatted paths to deeply nested keys. For example, if the following JSON file is loaded: ```json { ""host"": { ""address"": ""localhost"", ""port"": 5799 }, ""datastore"": { ""metric"": { ""host"": ""127.0.0.1"", ""port"": 3099 }, ""warehouse"": { ""host"": ""198.0.0.1"", ""port"": 2112 } } } ``` Viper can access a nested field by passing a `.` delimited path of keys: ```go GetString(""datastore.metric.host"") // (returns ""127.0.0.1"") ``` This obeys the precedence rules established above; the search for the path will cascade through the remaining configuration registries until found. For example, given this configuration file, both `datastore.metric.host` and `datastore.metric.port` are already defined (and may be overridden). If in addition `datastore.metric.protocol` was defined in the defaults, Viper would also find it. However, if `datastore.metric` was overridden (by a flag, an environment variable, the `Set()` method, ) with an immediate value, then all sub-keys of `datastore.metric` become undefined, they are shadowed by the higher-priority configuration level. Viper can access array indices by using numbers in the path. For example: ```jsonc { ""host"": { ""address"": ""localhost"", ""ports"": [ 5799, 6029 ] }, ""datastore"": { ""metric"": { ""host"": ""127.0.0.1"", ""port"": 3099 }, ""warehouse"": { ""host"": ""198.0.0.1"", ""port"": 2112 } } } GetInt(""host.ports.1"") // returns 6029 ``` Lastly, if there exists a key that matches the delimited key path, its value will be returned instead. E.g. ```jsonc { ""datastore.metric.host"": ""0.0.0.0"", ""host"": { ""address"": ""localhost"", ""port"": 5799 }, ""datastore"": { ""metric"": { ""host"": ""127.0.0.1"", ""port"": 3099 }, ""warehouse"": { ""host"": ""198.0.0.1"", ""port"": 2112 } } } GetString(""datastore.metric.host"") // returns ""0.0.0.0"" ``` ### Extracting a sub-tree When developing reusable modules, it's often useful to extract a subset of the configuration and pass it to a module. This way the module can be instantiated more than once, with different configurations. For example, an application might use multiple different cache stores for different purposes: ```yaml cache: cache1: max-items: 100 item-size: 64 cache2: max-items: 200 item-size: 80 ``` We could pass the cache name to a module (eg. `NewCache(""cache1"")`), but it would require weird concatenation for accessing config keys and would be less separated from the global config. So instead of doing that let's pass a Viper instance to the constructor that represents a subset of the configuration: ```go cache1Config := viper.Sub(""cache.cache1"") if cache1Config == nil { // Sub returns nil if the key cannot be found panic(""cache configuration not found"") } cache1 := NewCache(cache1Config) ``` **Note:** Always check the return value of `Sub`. It returns `nil` if a key cannot be found. Internally, the `NewCache` function can address `max-items` and `item-size` keys directly: ```go func NewCache(v *Viper) *Cache { return &Cache{ MaxItems: v.GetInt(""max-items""), ItemSize: v.GetInt(""item-size""), } } ``` The resulting code is easy to test, since it's decoupled from the main config structure, and easier to reuse (for the same reason). ### Unmarshaling You also have the option of Unmarshaling all or a specific value to a struct, map, etc. There are two methods to do this: * `Unmarshal(rawVal any) : error` * `UnmarshalKey(key string, rawVal any) : error` Example: ```go type config struct { Port int Name string PathMap string `mapstructure:""path_map""` } var C config err := viper.Unmarshal(&C) if err != nil { t.Fatalf(""unable to decode into struct, %v"", err) } ``` If you want to unmarshal configuration where the keys themselves contain dot (the default key delimiter), you have to change the delimiter: ```go v := viper.NewWithOptions(viper.KeyDelimiter(""::"")) v.SetDefault(""chart::values"", map[string]any{ ""ingress"": map[string]any{ ""annotations"": map[string]any{ ""traefik.frontend.rule.type"": ""PathPrefix"", ""traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect"": ""true"", }, }, }) type config struct { Chart struct{ Values map[string]any } } var C config v.Unmarshal(&C) ``` Viper also supports unmarshaling into embedded structs: ```go /* Example config: module: enabled: true token: 89h3f98hbwf987h3f98wenf89ehf */ type config struct { Module struct { Enabled bool moduleConfig `mapstructure:"",squash""` } } // moduleConfig could be in a module specific package type moduleConfig struct { Token string } var C config err := viper.Unmarshal(&C) if err != nil { t.Fatalf(""unable to decode into struct, %v"", err) } ``` Viper uses [github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure]( under the hood for unmarshaling values which uses `mapstructure` tags by default. ### Decoding custom formats A frequently requested feature for Viper is adding more value formats and decoders. For example, parsing character (dot, comma, semicolon, etc) separated strings into slices. This is already available in Viper using mapstructure decode hooks. Read more about the details in [this blog post]( ### Marshalling to string You may need to marshal all the settings held in viper into a string rather than write them to a file. You can use your favorite format's marshaller with the config returned by `AllSettings()`. ```go import ( yaml ""gopkg.in/yaml.v2"" // ... ) func yamlStringSettings() string { c := viper.AllSettings() bs, err := yaml.Marshal(c) if err != nil { log.Fatalf(""unable to marshal config to YAML: %v"", err) } return string(bs) } ``` ## Viper or Vipers? Viper comes ready to use out of the box. There is no configuration or initialization needed to begin using Viper. Since most applications will want to use a single central repository for their configuration, the viper package provides this. It is similar to a singleton. In all of the examples above, they demonstrate using viper in its singleton style approach. ### Working with multiple vipers You can also create many different vipers for use in your application. Each will have its own unique set of configurations and values. Each can read from a different config file, key value store, etc. All of the functions that viper package supports are mirrored as methods on a viper. Example: ```go x := viper.New() y := viper.New() x.SetDefault(""ContentDir"", ""content"") y.SetDefault(""ContentDir"", ""foobar"") //... ``` When working with multiple vipers, it is up to the user to keep track of the different vipers. ## Q & A ### Why is it called Viper? A: Viper is designed to be a [companion]( to [Cobra]( While both can operate completely independently, together they make a powerful pair to handle much of your application foundation needs. ### Why is it called Cobra? Is there a better name for a [commander]( ### Does Viper support case sensitive keys? **tl;dr:** No. Viper merges configuration from various sources, many of which are either case insensitive or uses different casing than the rest of the sources (eg. env vars). In order to provide the best experience when using multiple sources, the decision has been made to make all keys case insensitive. There has been several attempts to implement case sensitivity, but unfortunately it's not that trivial. We might take a stab at implementing it in [Viper v2]( but despite the initial noise, it does not seem to be requested that much. You can vote for case sensitivity by filling out this feedback form: ### Is it safe to concurrently read and write to a viper? No, you will need to synchronize access to the viper yourself (for example by using the `sync` package). Concurrent reads and writes can cause a panic. ## Troubleshooting See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). ## Development **For an optimal developer experience, it is recommended to install [Nix]( and [direnv]( _Alternatively, install [Go]( on your computer then run `make deps` to install the rest of the dependencies._ Run the test suite: ```shell make test ``` Run linters: ```shell make lint # pass -j option to run them in parallel ``` Some linter violations can automatically be fixed: ```shell make fmt ``` ## License The project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).","2k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, kind/enhancement, kind/bug, area/dependencies, kind/support, kind/question, release-note/new-feature, resolution/wontfix, resolution/invalid, resolution/duplicate, release-note/misc, release-note/ignore, release-note/enhancement, release-note/deprecation, release-note/dependency-update, release-note/bug-fix, release-note/breaking-change, help wanted, good first issue, area/documentation"

K9s provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources. --- ## Note... K9s is not pimped out by a big corporation with deep pockets. It is a complex OSS project that demands a lot of my time to maintain and support. K9s will always remain OSS and therefore free! That said, if you feel k9s makes your day to day Kubernetes journey a tad brighter, saves you time and makes you more productive, please consider [sponsoring us!]( Your donations will go a long way in keeping our servers lights on and beers in our fridge! **Thank you!** --- []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( --- ## Screenshots 1.

In order to build K9s from source you must: 1. Clone the repo 2. Build and run the executable ```shell make build && ./execs/k9s ``` --- ## Running with Docker ### Running the official Docker image You can run k9s as a Docker container by mounting your `KUBECONFIG`: ```shell docker run --rm -it -v $KUBECONFIG:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s ``` For default path it would be: ```shell docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s ``` ### Building your own Docker image You can build your own Docker image of k9s from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with the following: ```shell docker build -t k9s-docker:v0.0.1 . ``` You can get the latest stable `kubectl` version and pass it to the `docker build` command with the `--build-arg` option. You can use the `--build-arg` option to pass any valid `kubectl` version (like `v1.18.0` or `v1.19.1`). ```shell KUBECTL_VERSION=$(make kubectl-stable-version 2>/dev/null) docker build --build-arg KUBECTL_VERSION=${KUBECTL_VERSION} -t k9s-docker:0.1 . ``` Run your container: ```shell docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config k9s-docker:0.1 ``` --- ## PreFlight Checks * K9s uses 256 colors terminal mode. On `Nix system make sure TERM is set accordingly. ```shell export TERM=xterm-256color ``` * In order to issue resource edit commands make sure your EDITOR and KUBE_EDITOR env vars are set. ```shell # Kubectl edit command will use this env var. export KUBE_EDITOR=my_fav_editor ``` * K9s prefers recent kubernetes versions ie 1.28+ --- ## K8S Compatibility Matrix | k9s | k8s client | | ------------------ | ---------- | | >= v0.27.0 | 1.26.1 | | v0.26.7 - v0.26.6 | 1.25.3 | | v0.26.5 - v0.26.4 | 1.25.1 | | v0.26.3 - v0.26.1 | 1.24.3 | | v0.26.0 - v0.25.19 | 1.24.2 | | v0.25.18 - v0.25.3 | 1.22.3 | | v0.25.2 - v0.25.0 | 1.22.0 | | <= v0.24 | 1.21.3 | --- ## The Command Line ```shell # List current version k9s version # To get info about K9s runtime (logs, configs, etc..) k9s info # List all available CLI options k9s help # To run K9s in a given namespace k9s -n mycoolns # Start K9s in an existing KubeConfig context k9s --context coolCtx # Start K9s in readonly mode - with all cluster modification commands disabled k9s --readonly ``` ## Logs And Debug Logs Given the nature of the ui k9s does produce logs to a specific location.

K9s leverages [XDG]( to load its various configurations files. For information on the default locations for your OS please see [this link]( If you are still confused a quick `k9s info` will reveal where k9s is loading its configurations from. Alternatively, you can set `K9S_CONFIG_DIR` to tell K9s the directory location to pull its configurations from. | Unix | macOS | Windows | |-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------| | `~/.config/k9s` | `~/Library/Application Support/k9s` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\k9s` | > NOTE: This is still in flux and will change while in pre-release stage! ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml k9s: # Enable periodic refresh of resource browser windows. Default false liveViewAutoRefresh: false # The path to screen dump. Default: '%temp_dir%/k9s-screens-%username%' (k9s info) screenDumpDir: /tmp/dumps # Represents ui poll intervals.

Popeye itself uses a configuration called `spinach.yml`, but when integrating with K9s the cluster-specific file should be name `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/share/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/spinach.yml`. This allows you to have a different spinach config per cluster. --- ## Node Shell By enabling the nodeShell feature gate on a given cluster, K9s allows you to shell into your cluster nodes. Once enabled, you will have a new `s` for `shell` menu option while in node view. K9s will launch a pod on the selected node using a special k9s_shell pod. Furthermore, you can refine your shell pod by using a custom docker image preloaded with the shell tools you love. By default k9s uses a BusyBox image, but you can configure it as follows: ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml k9s: # You can also further tune the shell pod specification shellPod: image: cool_kid_admin:42 namespace: blee limits: cpu: 100m memory: 100Mi ``` Then in your cluster configuration file... ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/cluster-1/context-1 k9s: cluster: cluster-1 readOnly: false namespace: active: default lockFavorites: false favorites: - kube-system - default view: active: po featureGates: nodeShell: true # => Enable this feature gate to make nodeShell available on this cluster portForwardAddress: localhost ``` --- ## Command Aliases In K9s, you can define your very own command aliases (shortnames) to access your resources. In your `$HOME/.config/k9s` define a file called `aliases.yaml`. A K9s alias defines pairs of alias:gvr. A gvr (Group/Version/Resource) represents a fully qualified Kubernetes resource identifier. Here is an example of an alias file: ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/aliases.yaml aliases: pp: v1/pods crb: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterrolebindings # As of v0.30.0 you can also refer to another command alias... fred: pod fred app=blee # => view pods in namespace fred with labels matching app=blee ``` Using this aliases file, you can now type `:pp` or `:crb` or `:fred` to activate their respective commands. --- ## HotKey Support Entering the command mode and typing a resource name or alias, could be cumbersome for navigating thru often used resources. We're introducing hotkeys that allow users to define their own key combination to activate their favorite resource views. Additionally, you can define context specific hotkeys by add a context level configuration file in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/hotkeys.yaml` In order to surface hotkeys globally please follow these steps: 1. Create a file named `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/hotkeys.yaml` 2. Add the following to your `hotkeys.yaml`. You can use resource name/short name to specify a command ie same as typing it while in command mode. ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/hotkeys.yaml hotKeys: # Hitting Shift-0 navigates to your pod view shift-0: shortCut: Shift-0 description: Viewing pods command: pods # Hitting Shift-1 navigates to your deployments shift-1: shortCut: Shift-1 description: View deployments command: dp # Hitting Shift-2 navigates to your xray deployments shift-2: shortCut: Shift-2 description: Xray Deployments command: xray deploy # Hitting Shift-S view the resources in the namespace of your current selection shift-s: shortCut: Shift-S override: true # => will override the default shortcut related action if set to true (default to false) description: Namespaced resources command: ""$RESOURCE_NAME $NAMESPACE"" keepHistory: true # whether you can return to the previous view ``` Not feeling so hot? Your custom hotkeys will be listed in the help view `?`. Also your hotkeys file will be automatically reloaded so you can readily use your hotkeys as you define them. You can choose any keyboard shortcuts that make sense to you, provided they are not part of the standard K9s shortcuts list. Similarly, referencing environment variables in hotkeys is also supported. The available environment variables can refer to the description in the [Plugins](#plugins) section. > NOTE: This feature/configuration might change in future releases! --- ## FastForwards As of v0.25.0, you can leverage the `FastForwards` feature to tell K9s how to default port-forwards. In situations where you are dealing with multiple containers or containers exposing multiple ports, it can be cumbersome to specify the desired port-forward from the dialog as in most cases, you already know which container/port tuple you desire. For these use cases, you can now annotate your manifests with the following annotations: @ `k9scli.io/auto-port-forwards` activates one or more port-forwards directly bypassing the port-forward dialog all together. @ `k9scli.io/port-forwards` pre-selects one or more port-forwards when launching the port-forward dialog. The annotation value takes on the shape `container-name::[local-port:]container-port` > NOTE: for either cases above you can specify the container port by name or number in your annotation! ### Example ```yaml # Pod fred apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: fred annotations: k9scli.io/auto-port-forwards: zorg::5556 # => will default to container zorg port 5556 and local port 5566. No port-forward dialog will be shown. # Or... k9scli.io/port-forwards: bozo::9090:p1 # => launches the port-forward dialog selecting default port-forward on container bozo port named p1(8081) # mapping to local port 9090. ... spec: containers: - name: zorg ports: - name: p1 containerPort: 5556 ... - name: bozo ports: - name: p1 containerPort: 8081 - name: p2 containerPort: 5555 ... ``` The annotation value must specify a container to forward to as well as a local port and container port. The container port may be specified as either a port number or port name. If the local port is omitted then the local port will default to the container port number. Here are a few examples: 1. bozo::http - creates a pf on container `bozo` with port name If http specifies port number 8080 then the local port will be 8080 as well. 2. bozo::9090:http - creates a pf on container `bozo` mapping local port 9090-> 3. bozo::9090:8080 - creates a pf on container `bozo` mapping local port 9090->8080 --- ## Resource Custom Columns [SneakCast v0.17.0 on The Beach! - Yup! sound is sucking but what a setting!]( You can change which columns shows up for a given resource via custom views. To surface this feature, you will need to create a new configuration file, namely `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/views.yaml`. This file leverages GVR (Group/Version/Resource) to configure the associated table view columns. If no GVR is found for a view the default rendering will take over (ie what we have now). Going wide will add all the remaining columns that are available on the given resource after your custom columns. To boot, you can edit your views config file and tune your resources views live! > NOTE: This is experimental and will most likely change as we iron this out! Here is a sample views configuration that customize a pods and services views. ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/views.yaml views: v1/pods: columns: - AGE - NAMESPACE - NAME - IP - NODE - STATUS - READY v1/services: columns: - AGE - NAMESPACE - NAME - TYPE - CLUSTER-IP ``` --- ## Plugins K9s allows you to extend your command line and tooling by defining your very own cluster commands via plugins. K9s will look at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/plugins.yaml` to locate all available plugins. A plugin is defined as follows: * Shortcut option represents the key combination a user would type to activate the plugin * Override option make that the default action related to the shortcut will be overrided by the plugin * Confirm option (when enabled) lets you see the command that is going to be executed and gives you an option to confirm or prevent execution * Description will be printed next to the shortcut in the k9s menu * Scopes defines a collection of resources names/short-names for the views associated with the plugin. You can specify `all` to provide this shortcut for all views. * Command represents ad-hoc commands the plugin runs upon activation * Background specifies whether or not the command runs in the background * Args specifies the various arguments that should apply to the command above * OverwriteOutput options allows plugin developers to provide custom messages on plugin execution K9s does provide additional environment variables for you to customize your plugins arguments. Currently, the available environment variables are as follows: * `$RESOURCE_GROUP` -- the selected resource group * `$RESOURCE_VERSION` -- the selected resource api version * `$RESOURCE_NAME` -- the selected resource name * `$NAMESPACE` -- the selected resource namespace * `$NAME` -- the selected resource name * `$CONTAINER` -- the current container if applicable * `$FILTER` -- the current filter if any * `$KUBECONFIG` -- the KubeConfig location. * `$CLUSTER` the active cluster name * `$CONTEXT` the active context name * `$USER` the active user * `$GROUPS` the active groups * `$POD` while in a container view * `$COL-` use a given column name for a viewed resource. Must be prefixed by `COL-`! Curly braces can be used to embed an environment variable inside another string, or if the column name contains special characters. (e.g. `${NAME}-example` or `${COL-%CPU/L}`) ### Plugin Example This defines a plugin for viewing logs on a selected pod using `ctrl-l` as shortcut. ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/plugins.yaml plugins: # Defines a plugin to provide a `ctrl-l` shortcut to tail the logs while in pod view. fred: shortCut: Ctrl-L override: false confirm: false description: Pod logs scopes: - pods command: kubectl background: false args: - logs - -f - $NAME - -n - $NAMESPACE - --context - $CONTEXT ``` > NOTE: This is an experimental feature! Options and layout may change in future K9s releases as this feature solidifies. --- ## Benchmark Your Applications K9s integrates [Hey]( from the brilliant and super talented [Jaana Dogan]( `Hey` is a CLI tool to benchmark HTTP endpoints similar to AB bench. This preliminary feature currently supports benchmarking port-forwards and services (Read the paint on this is way fresh!). To setup a port-forward, you will need to navigate to the PodView, select a pod and a container that exposes a given port. Using `SHIFT-F` a dialog comes up to allow you to specify a local port to forward. Once acknowledged, you can navigate to the PortForward view (alias `pf`) listing out your active port-forwards. Selecting a port-forward and using `CTRL-B` will run a benchmark on that HTTP endpoint. To view the results of your benchmark runs, go to the Benchmarks view (alias `be`). You should now be able to select a benchmark and view the run stats details by pressing ``. NOTE: Port-forwards only last for the duration of the K9s session and will be terminated upon exit. Initially, the benchmarks will run with the following defaults: * Concurrency Level: 1 * Number of Requests: 200 * HTTP Verb: GET * Path: / The PortForward view is backed by a new K9s config file namely: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/benchmarks.yaml`. Each cluster you connect to will have its own bench config file, containing the name of the K8s context for the cluster. Changes to this file should automatically update the PortForward view to indicate how you want to run your benchmarks. Benchmarks result reports are stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY` Here is a sample benchmarks.yaml configuration. Please keep in mind this file will likely change in subsequent releases! ```yaml # This file resides in $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/benchmarks.yaml benchmarks: # Indicates the default concurrency and number of requests setting if a container or service rule does not match. defaults: # One concurrent connection concurrency: 1 # Number of requests that will be sent to an endpoint requests: 500 containers: # Containers section allows you to configure your http container's endpoints and benchmarking settings. # NOTE: the container ID syntax uses namespace/pod-name:container-name default/nginx:nginx: # Benchmark a container named nginx using POST HTTP verb using URL and headers. concurrency: 1 requests: 10000 path: /bozo method: POST body: {""fred"":""blee""} header: Accept: - text/html Content-Type: - application/json services: # Similarly you can Benchmark an HTTP service exposed either via NodePort, LoadBalancer types. # Service ID is ns/svc-name default/nginx: # Set the concurrency level concurrency: 5 # Number of requests to be sent requests: 500 method: GET # This setting will depend on whether service is NodePort or LoadBalancer. NodePort may require vendor port tunneling setting. # Set this to a node if NodePort or LB if applicable. IP or dns name. host: A.B.C.D path: /bumblebeetuna auth: user: jean-baptiste-emmanuel password: Zorg! ``` --- ## K9s RBAC FU On RBAC enabled clusters, you would need to give your users/groups capabilities so that they can use K9s to explore their Kubernetes cluster. K9s needs minimally read privileges at both the cluster and namespace level to display resources and metrics. These rules below are just suggestions. You will need to customize them based on your environment policies. If you need to edit/delete resources extra Fu will be necessary. > NOTE! Cluster/Namespace access may change in the future as K9s evolves. > NOTE! We expect K9s to keep running even in atrophied clusters/namespaces. Please file issues if this is not the case! ### Cluster RBAC scope ```yaml --- # K9s Reader ClusterRole kind: ClusterRole apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: k9s rules: # Grants RO access to cluster resources node and namespace - apiGroups: [""""] resources: [""nodes"", ""namespaces""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to RBAC resources - apiGroups: [""rbac.authorization.k8s.io""] resources: [""clusterroles"", ""roles"", ""clusterrolebindings"", ""rolebindings""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to CRD resources - apiGroups: [""apiextensions.k8s.io""] resources: [""customresourcedefinitions""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to metric server (if present) - apiGroups: [""metrics.k8s.io""] resources: [""nodes"", ""pods""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] --- # Sample K9s user ClusterRoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: k9s subjects: - kind: User name: fernand apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: k9s apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io ``` ### Namespace RBAC scope If your users are constrained to certain namespaces, K9s will need to following role to enable read access to namespaced resources. ```yaml --- # K9s Reader Role (default namespace) kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: k9s namespace: default rules: # Grants RO access to most namespaced resources - apiGroups: ["""", ""apps"", ""autoscaling"", ""batch"", ""extensions""] resources: [""*""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to metric server - apiGroups: [""metrics.k8s.io""] resources: [""pods"", ""nodes""] verbs: - get - list - watch --- # Sample K9s user RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: k9s namespace: default subjects: - kind: User name: fernand apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: Role name: k9s apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io ``` --- ## Skins Example: Dracula Skin ;) You can style K9s based on your own sense of look and style. Skins are YAML files, that enable a user to change the K9s presentation layer. See this repo `skins` directory for examples. You can skin k9s by default by specifying a UI.skin attribute. You can also change K9s skins based on the context you are connecting too. In this case, you can specify a skin field on your cluster config aka `skin: dracula` (just the name of the skin file without the extension!) and copy this repo `skins/dracula.yaml` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/skins/` directory. In the case where your cluster spans several contexts, you can add a skin context configuration to your context configuration. This is a collection of {context_name, skin} tuples (please see example below!) Colors can be defined by name or using a hex representation. Of recent, we've added a color named `default` to indicate a transparent background color to preserve your terminal background color settings if so desired. > NOTE: This is very much an experimental feature at this time, more will be added/modified if this feature has legs so thread accordingly! > NOTE: Please see [K9s Skins]( for a list of available colors. To skin a specific context and provided the file `in_the_navy.yaml` is present in your skins directory. ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/config.yaml k9s: cluster: clusterX skin: in_the_navy readOnly: false namespace: active: default lockFavorites: false favorites: - kube-system - default view: active: po featureGates: nodeShell: false portForwardAddress: localhost ``` You can also specify a default skin for all contexts in the root k9s config file as so: ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml k9s: liveViewAutoRefresh: false screenDumpDir: /tmp/dumps refreshRate: 2 maxConnRetry: 5 readOnly: false noExitOnCtrlC: false ui: enableMouse: false headless: false logoless: false crumbsless: false noIcons: false # Toggles reactive UI.

cosmopolitan,jart/cosmopolitan,15411,"['C', 'POV-Ray SDL', 'Assembly']","['polyglot', 'containers', 'linux', 'openbsd', 'netbsd']","[]( # Cosmopolitan [Cosmopolitan Libc]( makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, like Java, except it doesn't need an interpreter or virtual machine. Instead, it reconfigures stock GCC and Clang to output a POSIX-approved polyglot format that runs natively on Linux + Mac + Windows + FreeBSD + OpenBSD + NetBSD + BIOS with the best possible performance and the tiniest footprint imaginable. ## Background For an introduction to this project, please read the [actually portable executable]( blog post and [cosmopolitan libc]( website. We also have [API documentation]( ## Getting Started You can start by obtaining a release of our `cosmocc` compiler from . ```sh mkdir -p cosmocc cd cosmocc wget unzip cosmocc.zip ``` Here's an example program we can write: ```c // hello.c #include int main() { printf(""hello world\n""); } ``` It can be compiled as follows: ```sh cosmocc -o hello hello.c ./hello ``` The Cosmopolitan Libc runtime links some heavyweight troubleshooting features by default, which are very useful for developers and admins. Here's how you can log system calls: ```sh ./hello --strace ``` Here's how you can get a much more verbose log of function calls: ```sh ./hello --ftrace ``` You can use the Cosmopolitan's toolchain to build conventional open source projects which use autotools. This strategy normally works: ```sh export CC=x86_64-unknown-cosmo-cc export CXX=x86_64-unknown-cosmo-c++ ./configure --prefix=/opt/cosmos/x86_64 make -j make install ``` ## Cosmopolitan Source Builds Cosmopolitan can be compiled from source on any of our supported platforms. The Makefile will download cosmocc automatically. It's recommended that you install a systemwide APE Loader. This command requires `sudo` access to copy the `ape` command to a system folder and register with binfmt_misc on Linux, for even more performance. ```sh ape/apeinstall.sh ``` You can now build the mono repo with any modern version of GNU Make. To make life easier, we've included one in the cosmocc toolchain, which is guaranteed to be compatible and furthermore includes our extensions for doing build system sandboxing. ```sh build/bootstrap/make -j8 o//examples/hello ``` Since the Cosmopolitan repository is very large, you might only want to build one particular thing. Here's an example of a target that can be compiled relatively quickly, which is a simple POSIX test that only depends on core LIBC packages. ```sh rm -rf o//libc o//test build/bootstrap/make o//test/posix/signal_test o//test/posix/signal_test ``` Sometimes it's desirable to build a subset of targets, without having to list out each individual one. For example if you wanted to build and run all the unit tests in the `TEST_POSIX` package, you could say: ```sh build/bootstrap/make o//test/posix ``` Cosmopolitan provides a variety of build modes. For example, if you want really tiny binaries (as small as 12kb in size) then you'd say: ```sh build/bootstrap/make m=tiny ``` You can furthermore cut out the bloat of other operating systems, and have Cosmopolitan become much more similar to Musl Libc. ```sh build/bootstrap/make m=tinylinux ``` For further details, see [//build/config.mk](build/config.mk). ## Debugging To print a log of system calls to stderr: ```sh cosmocc -o hello hello.c ./hello --strace ``` To print a log of function calls to stderr: ```sh cosmocc -o hello hello.c ./hello --ftrace ``` Both strace and ftrace use the unbreakable kprintf() facility, which is able to be sent to a file by setting an environment variable. ```sh export KPRINTF_LOG=log ./hello --strace ``` ## GDB Here's the recommended `~/.gdbinit` config: ```gdb set host-charset UTF-8 set target-charset UTF-8 set target-wide-charset UTF-8 set osabi none set complaints 0 set confirm off set history save on set history filename ~/.gdb_history define asm layout asm layout reg end define src layout src layout reg end src ``` You normally run the `.dbg` file under gdb. If you need to debug the `` file itself, then you can load the debug symbols independently as ```sh gdb foo -ex 'add-symbol-file foo.dbg 0x401000' ``` ## Platform Notes ### Shells If you use zsh and have trouble running APE programs try `sh -c ./prog` or simply upgrade to zsh 5.9+ (since we patched it two years ago). The same is the case for Python `subprocess`, old versions of fish, etc. ### Linux Some Linux systems are configured to launch MZ executables under WINE. Other distros configure their stock installs so that APE programs will print ""run-detectors: unable to find an interpreter"". For example: ```sh jart@ubuntu:~$ wget jart@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x dash jart@ubuntu:~$ ./dash run-detectors: unable to find an interpreter for ./dash ``` You can fix that by registering APE with `binfmt_misc`: ```sh sudo wget -O /usr/bin/ape -m).elf sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ape sudo sh -c ""echo ':APE:M::MZqFpD::/usr/bin/ape:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register"" sudo sh -c ""echo ':APE-jart:M::jartsr::/usr/bin/ape:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register"" ``` You should be good now. APE will not only work, it'll launch executables 400s faster now too. However if things still didn't work out, it's also possible to disable `binfmt_misc` as follows: ```sh sudo sh -c 'echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/cli' # remove Ubuntu's MZ interpreter sudo sh -c 'echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status' # remove ALL binfmt_misc entries ``` ### WSL It's normally unsafe to use APE in a WSL environment, because it tries to run MZ executables as WIN32 binaries within the WSL environment. In order to make it safe to use Cosmopolitan software on WSL, run this: ```sh sudo sh -c ""echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop"" ``` ## Discord Chatroom The Cosmopolitan development team collaborates on the Redbean Discord server.

Mailspring,Foundry376/Mailspring,15165,"['C', 'TypeScript', 'JavaScript']","['email', 'mail', 'electron', 'osx', 'windows']","# Mailspring []( []( **Mailspring is a new version of Nylas Mail maintained by one of the original authors. It's faster, leaner, and shipping today!** It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2]( It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero ""CPU Wakes"", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features. Mailspring's UI is open source (GPLv3) and written in TypeScript with [Electron]( and [React]( - it's built on a plugin architecture and was designed to be easy to extend. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md]( to get started! Mailspring's sync engine is spawned by the Electron application and runs locally on your computer. [It is open source (GPLv3) and written in C++ and C.]( For convenience, however, when you set up your development environment, Mailspring uses the latest version of the sync engine we've shipped for your platform so you don't need to pull sources or install its compile-time dependencies. ## Features Mailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send Later, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock with a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton of email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company profiles. **All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send your email credentials to the cloud.** For a full list of features, check out [getmailspring.com]( ## Download Mailspring You can download compiled versions of Mailspring for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (deb, rpm and snap) from [ ## Getting Help You can find community-based help and discussion with other Mailspring users on our [Discourse community]( ## Contributing Mailspring is entirely open-source. Pull requests and contributions are welcome! There are three ways to contribute: building a plugin, building a theme, and submitting pull requests to the project itself. When you're getting started, you may want to join our [Discourse]( so you can ask questions and learn from other people doing development. [](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ### Running Mailspring from Source To install all dependencies and run Mailspring from its source code, run the following commands from the root directory of the Mailspring repository: ``` export npm_config_arch=x64 # If you are on an M1 / Apple Silicon Mac npm install npm start ``` You can attach command line parameters by separating them using a double hyphen: ``` npm start -- --help ``` ### Building Mailspring To build Mailspring, you need to run the following command from the root directory of the Mailspring repository: ``` npm run-script build ``` ### Building A Plugin Plugins lie at the heart of Mailspring and give it its powerful features. Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools, experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started guide]( to write your first plugin in five minutes. - To create your own theme, check out the [Mailspring-Theme-Starter]( - To create your own plugin, check out the [Mailspring-Plugin-Starter]( A plugin ""store"" like the Chrome Web Store is coming soon, and will make it easy for other users to discover plugins you create. (Right now, users need to ""sideload"" the plugins into the app by downloading them and copying them into place.) You can share and browse Mailspring Plugins, and discuss plugin development with other developers, on our [Discourse]( ### Building a Theme The Mailspring user interface is styled using CSS, which means it's easy to modify and extend. Mailspring comes stock with a few beautiful themes, and there are many more which have been built by community developers. To start creating a theme, [clone the theme starter]( If you are updating an existing Nylas theme for Mailspring here is a [step by step tutorial]( Notice: as part of the update process you will probably need to [import mailspring base variables]( You can share and browse Mailspring Themes, and discuss theme development with other developers, on our [Discourse]( ### Localizing / Translating Mailspring (1.5.0 and above) supports localization. If you're a fluent speaker of another language, we'd love your help improving translations. Check out the [LOCALIZATION]( guide for more information. You can discuss localization and translation with other developers on our [Discourse]( ### Contributing to Mailspring Core Pull requests are always welcome - check out [CONTRIBUTING]( for more information about setting up the development environment, running tests locally, and submitting pull requests.","886, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Security, Insights, product-direction, windows, support, stale, spooky, snapcraft, service-issue, rejected, question, performance, not-yet-possible, not-us, needs-reproduction, migration-by-op, migrated, mailserver-incompatibility, macos, linux, invalid, intl, interesting, good first issue, enhancement, electron-soon, done-pending-release, contacts, composer, close-after-inactivity, calendar, building-and-themeing"
blurhash,woltapp/blurhash,15125,"['C', 'Swift', 'SCSS']",[],"# [BlurHash]( BlurHash is a compact representation of a placeholder for an image. ## Why would you want this? Does your designer cry every time you load their beautifully designed screen, and it is full of empty boxes because all the images have not loaded yet? Does your database engineer cry when you want to solve this by trying to cram little thumbnail images into your data to show as placeholders? BlurHash will solve your problems! How? Like this: You can also see nice examples and try it out yourself at [blurha.sh]( ## How does it work? In short, BlurHash takes an image, and gives you a short string (only 20-30 characters!) that represents the placeholder for this image. You do this on the backend of your service, and store the string along with the image. When you send data to your client, you send both the URL to the image, and the BlurHash string. Your client then takes the string, and decodes it into an image that it shows while the real image is loading over the network. The string is short enough that it comfortably fits into whatever data format you use. For instance, it can easily be added as a field in a JSON object. In summary: Want to know all the gory technical details? Read the [algorithm description](Algorithm.md). Implementing the algorithm is actually quite easy! Implementations are short and easily ported to your favourite language or platform. ## Implementations So far, we have created these implementations: * [C](C) - An encoder implementation in portable C code. * [Swift](Swift) - Encoder and decoder implementations, and a larger library offering advanced features. There is also an example app to play around with the algorithm. * [Kotlin](Kotlin) - A decoder implementation for Android. * [TypeScript](TypeScript) - Encoder and decoder implementations, and an example page to test. * [Python]( - Integration of the C encoder code into Python.

Can't find the language you're looking for? Try your luck with the GitHub search. For example, here are the search results for [repos which have ""blurhash"" in their name]( Perhaps you'd like to help extend this list? Which brings us to... ## Contributing We'd love contributions! The algorithm is [very simple](Algorithm.md) - less than two hundred lines of code - and can easily be ported to your platform of choice. And having support for more platforms would be wonderful! So, Java decoder? Golang encoder? Haskell? Rust? We want them all! We will also try to tag any issues on our [issue tracker]( that we'd love help with, so if you just want to dip in, go have a look. You can file a pull request with us, or you can start your own repo and project if you want to run everything yourself, we don't mind. If you do want to contribute to this project, we have a [code of conduct](CodeOfConduct.md). ## Users Who uses BlurHash? Here are some projects we know about: * [Wolt]( - We are of course using it ourselves. BlurHashes are used in the mobile clients on iOS and Android, as well as on the web, as placeholders during image loading. * [Mastodon]( - The Mastodon decentralised social media network uses BlurHashes both as loading placeholders, as well as for hiding media marked as sensitive. * [Signal]( - Signal Private Messenger uses Blurhashes as placeholders before photo & video messages are downloaded in chat conversations. * [Jellyfin]( - Jellyfin the free software media system uses Blurhashes as placeholders for images of movies and TV shows when they are being downloaded. ## Good Questions ### How fast is encoding? Decoding? These implementations are not very optimised. Running them on very large images can be a bit slow. The performance of the encoder and decoder are about the same for the same input or output size, so decoding very large placeholders, especially on your UI thread, can also be a bit slow. However! The trick to using the algorithm efficiently is to not run it on full-sized data. The fine detail of an image is all thrown away, so you should scale your images down before running BlurHash on them. If you are creating thumbnails, run BlurHash on those instead of the full images. Similarly, when displaying the placeholders, very small images work very well when scaled up. We usually decode placeholders that are 32 or even 20 pixels wide, and then let the UI layer scale them up, which is indistinguishable from decoding them at full size. ### How do I pick the number of X and Y components? It depends a bit on taste. The more components you pick, the more information is retained in the placeholder, but the longer the BlurHash string will be. Also, it doesn't always look good with too many components. We usually go with 4 by 3, which seems to strike a nice balance. However, you should adjust the number of components depending on the aspect ratio of your images. For instance, very wide images should have more X components and fewer Y components. The Swift example project contains a test app where you can play around with the parameters and see the results. ### What is the `punch` parameter in some of these implementations? It is a parameter that adjusts the contrast on the decoded image. 1 means normal, smaller values will make the effect more subtle, and larger values will make it stronger. This is basically a design parameter, which lets you adjust the look. Technically, what it does is scale the AC components up or down. ### Is this only useful as an image loading placeholder? Well, that is what it was designed for originally, but it turns out to be useful for a few other things: * Masking images without having to use expensive blurs - [Mastodon]( uses it for this. * The data representation makes it quite easy to extract colour averages of the image for different areas. You can easily find approximations of things like the average colour of the top edge of the image, or of a corner. There is some code in the Swift BlurHashKit implementation to experiment with this. Also, the average colour of the entire image is just the DC component and can be decoded even without implementing any of the more complicated DCT stuff. * We have been meaning to try to implement tinted drop shadows for UI elements by using the BlurHash and extending the borders. Haven't actually had time to implement this yet though. ### Why base 83? First, 83 seems to be about how many low-ASCII characters you can find that are safe for use in all of JSON, HTML and shells. Secondly, 83 * 83 is very close to, and a little more than, 19 * 19 * 19, making it ideal for encoding three AC components in two characters. ### What about using the full Unicode character set to get a more efficient encoding? We haven't looked into how much overhead UTF-8 encoding would introduce versus base 83 in single-byte characters, but the encoding and decoding would probably be a lot more complicated, so in the spirit of minimalism BlurHash uses the simpler option. It might also be awkward to copy-paste, depending on OS capabilities. If you think it can be done and is worth it, though, do make your own version and show us! We'd love to see it in action. ### What about other basis representations than DCT? This is something we'd *love* to try. The DCT looks quite ugly when you increase the number of components, probably because the shape of the basis functions becomes too visible. Using a different basis with more aesthetically pleasing shape might be a big win. However, we have not managed come up with one. Some experimenting with a [Fourier-Bessel base]( targeted at images that are going to be cropped into circles has been done, but without much success. Here again we'd love to see what you can come up with! ## Authors * [Dag gren]( - Original algorithm design, Swift and C implementations * [Mykhailo Shchurov]( - Kotlin decoder implementation * [Hang Duy Khiem]( - Android demo app * [Olli Mahlamki]( - TypeScript decoder and encoder implementations * [Atte Lautanala]( - Python integration * [Lorenz Diener]( - Pure Python implementation * [Boris Momilovi]( - Pure PHP implementation * [Hendrik Schnepel]( - Java encoder implementation * [Tuomo Virolainen]( - Clojure implementation * [Fotis Papadogeorgopoulos]( - Rust and WebAssembly implementation * [Sam Protas]( - Pure Haskell implementation * [Markus Sammallahti]( - Scala implementation * [Kacper Perzankowski]( - Elixir encoder implementation * [Belvi Nosakhare]( - Kotlin extensions of Blurhash for ImageView, Glide, and Piccasso optimized for Android. * [Armedi]( - ReScript (BuckleScript) implementation. * [Ricardo Cruz]( - Xojo implementation. * [Marc Rousavy]( - React Native UI Component * [Matt Howard]( - Zig implementation * [Hannu Hartikainen]( - BQN implementation * [Wajahat Iqbal]( - Jetpack compose-based implementation optimized for using any component as a painter. * _Your name here?_","335, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, enhancement, Swift, Kotlin, question, algorithm, dependencies, documentation, TypeScript, C, website, needs reproduction, help wanted, good first issue, bug, wontfix, invalid, duplicate, JavaScript"

To request a license [contact Existential Audio](mailto:devinroth@existential.audio). ### Build & Install After building, to install BlackHole: 1. Copy or move the built `BlackHoleXch.driver` bundle to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL` 2. Restart CoreAudio using `sudo launchctl kickstart -kp system/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod` ### Customizing BlackHole The following pre-compiler constants may be used to easily customize a build of BlackHole. ``` kDriver_Name kPlugIn_BundleID kPlugIn_Icon kDevice_Name kDevice_IsHidden kDevice_HasInput kDevice_HasOutput kDevice2_Name kDevice2_IsHidden kDevice2_HasInput kDevice2_HasOutput kLatency_Frame_Size kNumber_Of_Channels kSampleRates ``` They can be specified at build time with `xcodebuild` using `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`. Example: ```bash xcodebuild \ -project BlackHole.xcodeproj \ GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS='$GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS kSomeConstant=value' ``` Be sure to escape any quotation marks when using strings. ### Renaming BlackHole To customize BlackHole it is required to change the following constants. - `kDriver_Name` - `kPlugIn_BundleID` (note that this must match the target bundleID) - `kPlugIn_Icon` These can specified as pre-compiler constants using ```xcodebuild```. ```bash driverName=""BlackHole"" bundleID=""audio.existential.BlackHole"" icon=""BlackHole.icns"" xcodebuild \ -project BlackHole.xcodeproj \ -configuration Release \ PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=$bundleID \ GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS='$GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS kDriver_Name=\""'$driverName'\"" kPlugIn_BundleID=\""'$bundleID'\"" kPlugIn_Icon=\""'$icon'\""' ``` ### Customizing Channels, Latency, and Sample Rates `kNumber_Of_Channels` is used to set the number of channels. Be careful when specifying high channel counts. Although BlackHole is designed to be extremely efficient at higher channel counts it's possible that your computer might not be able to keep up. Sample rates play a roll as well. Don't use high sample rates with a high number of channels. Some applications don't know how to handle high channel counts. Proceed with caution. `kLatency_Frame_Size` is how much time in frames that the driver has to process incoming and outgoing audio. It can be used to delay the audio inside of BlackHole up to a maximum of 65536 frames. This may be helpful if using BlackHole with a high channel count. `kSampleRates` set the sample rate or sample rates of the audio device. If using multiple sample rates separate each with a comma (`,`). For example: `kSampleRates='44100,48000'`. ### Mirror Device By default BlackHole has a hidden mirrored audio device. The devices may be customized using the following constants. ``` // Original Device kDevice_IsHidden kDevice_HasInput kDevice_HasOutput // Mirrored Device kDevice2_IsHidden kDevice2_HasInput kDevice2_HasOutput ``` When all are set to true a 2nd BlackHole will show up that works exactly the same. The inputs and outputs are mirrored so the outputs from both devices go to the inputs of both devices. This is useful if you need a separate device for input and output. Example ``` // Original Device kDevice_IsHidden=false kDevice_HasInput=true kDevice_HasOutput=false // Mirrored Device kDevice2_IsHidden=false kDevice2_HasInput=false kDevice2_HasOutput=true ``` In this situation we have two BlackHole devices. One will have inputs only and the other will have outputs only. One way to use this in projects is to hide the mirrored device and use it behind the scenes. That way the user will see an input only device while routing audio through to the output behind them scenes. Hidden audio devices can be accessed using `kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice`. ### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment BlackHole can be integrated into your CI/CD. Take a look at the [create_installer.sh]( shell script to see how the installer is built, signed and notarized. ## Feature Requests If you are interested in any of the following features please leave a comment in the linked issue. To request a features not listed please create a new issue. - [Sync Clock with other Audio Devices]( in development see v0.3.0 - [Output Blackhole to other Audio Device]( - [Add Support for AU Plug-ins]( - [Inter-channel routing]( - [Record Directly to File]( - [Configuration Options Menu]( - [Support for Additional Bit Depths]( ## FAQ ### Why isn't BlackHole showing up in the Applications folder? BlackHole is a virtual audio loopback driver. It only shows up in `Audio MIDI Setup`, `Sound Preferences`, or other audio applications. ### How can I listen to the audio and use BlackHole at the same time? See [Setup a Multi-Output Device]( ### What bit depth does BlackHole use, and can I change it? BlackHole uses 32-bit float bit depth since macOS Core Audio natively uses 32-bit at the system level. This provides the broadest compatibility and greatest audio headroom. This format is lossless for up to 24-bit integer. All applications should be able to playback and record audio, and do not require adjusting bit depth at the BlackHole driver level. ### How can I change the volume of a Multi-Output device? Unfortunately macOS does not support changing the volume of a Multi-Output device but you can set the volume of individual devices in Audio MIDI Setup. ### Why is nothing playing through BlackHole? - Check `System Preferences` `Security & Privacy` `Privacy` `Microphone` to make sure your digital audio workstation (DAW) application has microphone access. - Check that the volume is all the way up on BlackHole input and output in ``Audio MIDI Setup``. - If you are using a multi-output device, due to issues with macOS the Built-in Output must be enabled and listed as the top device in the Multi-Output. [See here for details]( ### Why is audio glitching after X minutes when using a multi-output or an aggregate? - You need to enable drift correction for all devices except the Clock Source also known as Master Device or Primary Device. ### Why is the Installer failing? - Certain versions of macOS have a known issue where install packages may fail to install when the install package is located in certain folders. If you downloaded the .pkg file to your Downloads folder, try moving it to the Desktop and open the .pkg again (or vice-versa). ### What Apps Don't Work with Multi-Outputs? Unfortunately multi-outputs can be buggy and some apps won't work with them at all. Here is a list of known ones. If additional incompatible applications are found, please report them by opening an [issue]( - Apple Podcasts - Apple Messages - HDHomeRun ### AirPods with an Aggregate/Multi-Output is not working. The microphone from AirPods runs at a lower sample rate which means it should not be used as the primary/clock device in an Aggregate or Multi-Output device. The solution is to use your built-in speakers (and just mute them) or BlackHole 2ch as the primary/clock device. BlackHole 16ch will not work as the primary since the primary needs to have 2ch. Read [this discussion]( for more details. ### Can I integrate BlackHole into my app? BlackHole is licensed under GPL-3.0. You can use BlackHole as long as your app is also licensed as GPL-3.0. For all other applications please [contact Existential Audio directly](mailto:devinroth@existential.audio). ## Links and Resources ### [MultiSoundChanger]( A small tool for changing sound volume even for aggregate devices cause native sound volume controller can't change volume of aggregate devices ### [BackgroundMusic]( Background Music, a macOS audio utility: automatically pause your music, set individual apps' volumes and record system audio.","560, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Wiki, Security, Insights, wontfix, bug, Blame Apple, setup, pending closure, help wanted, good first issue, enhancement, duplicate, documentation, audio quality, Missing Information"

ReactOS is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system that is compatible with applications and drivers written for the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7). The ReactOS project, although currently focused on Windows Server 2003 compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with Windows Vista and future Windows NT releases. The code of ReactOS is licensed under [GNU GPL 2.0]( ### Product quality warning **ReactOS is currently an Alpha quality operating system.** This means that ReactOS is under heavy development and you have to be ready to encounter some problems. Different things may not work well and it can corrupt the data present on your hard disk. It is HIGHLY recommended to test ReactOS on a virtual machine or on a computer with no sensitive or critical data! ## Building [![rosbewin.badge]][rosbewin.link] [![rosbeunix.badge]][rosbeunix.link] [![coverity.badge]][coverity.link] To build the system it is strongly advised to use the _ReactOS Build Environment (RosBE)._ Up-to-date versions for Windows and for Unix/GNU-Linux are available from our download page at: [""Build Environment""]( Alternatively one can use Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version 2019+. Building with MSVC is covered here: [""Visual Studio or Microsoft Visual C++""]( See [""Building ReactOS""]( article for more details. ### Binaries To build ReactOS you must run the `configure` script in the directory you want to have your build files. Choose `configure.cmd` or `configure.sh` depending on your system. Then run `ninja ` to build a module you want or just `ninja` to build all modules. ### Bootable images To build a bootable CD image run `ninja bootcd` from the build directory. This will create a CD image with a filename `bootcd.iso`. You can always download fresh binary builds of bootable images from the [""Daily builds""]( page. ## Installing By default, ReactOS currently can only be installed on a machine that has a FAT16 or FAT32 partition as the active (bootable) partition. The partition on which ReactOS is to be installed (which may or may not be the bootable partition) must also be formatted as FAT16 or FAT32. ReactOS Setup can format the partitions if needed. Starting with 0.4.10, ReactOS can be installed using the BtrFS file system. But consider this as an experimental feature and thus regressions not triggered on FAT setup may be observed. To install ReactOS from the bootable CD distribution, extract the archive contents. Then burn the CD image, boot from it, and follow the instructions. See [""Installing ReactOS""]( Wiki page or [INSTALL](INSTALL) for more details. ## Testing If you discover a bug in ReactOS search on JIRA first - it might be reported already. If not report the bug providing logs and as much information as possible. See [""File Bugs""]( for a guide. __NOTE:__ The bug tracker is _not_ for discussions.

It is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past. ReactOS is also not ""yet another OS"". It does not attempt to be a third player like any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall Linux and use ReactOS instead; ReactOS is a replacement for Windows users who want a Windows replacement that behaves just like Windows.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on its way towards this goal. ## Table of Contents - [Main Features](#main-features) - [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it) - [Dependencies](#dependencies) - [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources) - [License](#license) - [Documentation](#documentation) - [Background](#background) - [Getting Help](#getting-help) - [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development) - [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas) ## Main Features Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well: - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of large data sets - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data sets - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of data sets - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick) - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files] (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db], and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore] - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging [missing-data]: [insertion-deletion]: [alignment]: [groupby]: [conversion]: [slicing]: [fancy-indexing]: [subsetting]: [merging]: [joining]: [reshape]: [pivot-table]: [mi]: [flat-files]: [excel]: [db]: [hdfstore]: [timeseries]: ## Where to get it The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI)]( and on [Conda]( ```sh # conda conda install -c conda-forge pandas ``` ```sh # or PyPI pip install pandas ``` The list of changes to pandas between each release can be found [here]( For full details, see the commit logs at ## Dependencies - [NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays]( - [python-dateutil - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module]( - [pytz - Brings the Olson tz database into Python which allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations]( See the [full installation instructions]( for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies. ## Installation from sources To install pandas from source you need [Cython]( in addition to the normal dependencies above. Cython can be installed from PyPI: ```sh pip install cython ``` In the `pandas` directory (same one where you found this file after cloning the git repo), execute: ```sh pip install . ``` or for installing in [development mode]( ```sh python -m pip install -ve . --no-build-isolation --config-settings=editable-verbose=true ``` See the full instructions for [installing from source]( ## License [BSD 3](LICENSE) ## Documentation The official documentation is hosted on [PyData.org]( ## Background Work on ``pandas`` started at [AQR]( (a quantitative hedge fund) in 2008 and has been under active development since then. ## Getting Help For usage questions, the best place to go to is [StackOverflow]( Further, general questions and discussions can also take place on the [pydata mailing list]( ## Discussion and Development Most development discussions take place on GitHub in this repo, via the [GitHub issue tracker]( Further, the [pandas-dev mailing list]( can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a [Slack channel]( is available for quick development related questions. There are also frequent [community meetings]( for project maintainers open to the community as well as monthly [new contributor meetings]( to help support new contributors. Additional information on the communication channels can be found on the [contributor community]( page. ## Contributing to pandas []( All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome. A detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the **[contributing guide]( If you are simply looking to start working with the pandas codebase, navigate to the [GitHub ""issues"" tab]( and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under [Docs]( and [good first issue]( where you could start out. You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to pandas on CodeTriage]( Or maybe through using pandas you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking this can be improved...you can do something about it!

Why you don't need design patterns in Python?]( [You Don't Need That!]( [Pluggable Libs Through Design Patterns]( Contributing ------------ When an implementation is added or modified, please review the following guidelines: ##### Docstrings Add module level description in form of a docstring with links to corresponding references or other useful information. Add ""Examples in Python ecosystem"" section if you know some. It shows how patterns could be applied to real-world problems. [facade.py](patterns/structural/facade.py) has a good example of detailed description, but sometimes the shorter one as in [template.py](patterns/behavioral/template.py) would suffice. ##### Python 2 compatibility To see Python 2 compatible versions of some patterns please check-out the [legacy]( tag. ##### Update README When everything else is done - update corresponding part of README. ##### Travis CI Please run the following before submitting a patch - `black .` This lints your code. Then either: - `tox` or `tox -e ci37` This runs unit tests. see tox.ini for further details. - If you have a bash compatible shell use `./lint.sh` This script will lint and test your code. This script mirrors the CI pipeline actions. You can also run `flake8` or `pytest` commands manually. Examples can be found in `tox.ini`. ## Contributing via issue triage []( You can triage issues and pull requests which may include reproducing bug reports or asking for vital information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions.

This allows you to access the unreleased features and bug fixes in the main branch. Installation can be made via ```bash pip install colossalai-nightly ``` ### Download From Source > The version of Colossal-AI will be in line with the main branch of the repository. Feel free to raise an issue if you encounter any problems. :) ```shell git clone cd ColossalAI # install colossalai pip install . ``` By default, we do not compile CUDA/C++ kernels. ColossalAI will build them during runtime. If you want to install and enable CUDA kernel fusion (compulsory installation when using fused optimizer): ```shell BUILD_EXT=1 pip install . ``` For Users with CUDA 10.2, you can still build ColossalAI from source. However, you need to manually download the cub library and copy it to the corresponding directory. ```bash # clone the repository git clone cd ColossalAI # download the cub library wget unzip 1.8.0.zip cp -r cub-1.8.0/cub/ colossalai/kernel/cuda_native/csrc/kernels/include/ # install BUILD_EXT=1 pip install . ``` (back to top) ## Use Docker ### Pull from DockerHub You can directly pull the docker image from our [DockerHub page]( The image is automatically uploaded upon release. ### Build On Your Own Run the following command to build a docker image from Dockerfile provided. > Building Colossal-AI from scratch requires GPU support, you need to use Nvidia Docker Runtime as the default when doing `docker build`. More details can be found [here]( > We recommend you install Colossal-AI from our [project page]( directly. ```bash cd ColossalAI docker build -t colossalai ./docker ``` Run the following command to start the docker container in interactive mode. ```bash docker run -ti --gpus all --rm --ipc=host colossalai bash ``` (back to top) ## Community Join the Colossal-AI community on [Forum]( [Slack]( and [WeChat()]( ""qrcode"") to share your suggestions, feedback, and questions with our engineering team. ## Contributing Referring to the successful attempts of [BLOOM]( and [Stable Diffusion]( any and all developers and partners with computing powers, datasets, models are welcome to join and build the Colossal-AI community, making efforts towards the era of big AI models!

However, the best practice for choosing the optimal parallel strategy is still lacking, as it requires domain expertise in both deep learning and parallel computing. The Colossal-AI system addressed the above challenge by introducing a unified interface to scale your sequential code of model training to distributed environments. It supports parallel training methods such as data, pipeline, tensor, and sequence parallelism and is integrated with heterogeneous training and zero redundancy optimizer.
