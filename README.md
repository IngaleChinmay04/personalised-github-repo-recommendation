## Introduction

This project aims to provide a robust recommender system for GitHub repositories. It involves fetching repository data, preprocessing the data, extracting relevant keywords, and generating recommendations based on similarity metrics.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve repository data, README content, and issues/labels from GitHub.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the fetched data.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract keywords using TF-IDF, LDA, and BERT.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Compute similarity between user preferences and repository features.
- **Recommendations**: Generate and display repository recommendations for users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Git
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-recommender-system.git
   cd github-recommender-system
2. Install the required python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add your github token to the enviroment:
   ```sh
   export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_github_token'

## Pipeline Overview

### Data Fetching

1. **Fetch Repository Data**: Use `fetch_repo_data.py` to gather repository metadata, README content, languages, and topics.
2. **Fetch Issue Labels**: Use `fetch_issue_labels.py` to scrape issue labels from repository pages.
3. **Fetch Trending Repositories**: Use `fetch_trending_repos.py` to get trending repositories based on language and spoken language.
4. **Fetch Trending Metadata**: Use `fetch_trending_repos_metadata.py` to gather metadata for trending repositories.
5. **Fetch Trending Issues Labels**: Use `fetch_trending_issues_labels.py` to scrape issue labels for trending repositories.

### Data Preprocessing and Keyword Extraction

1. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and preprocess the README content and issues.
2. **Extract Keywords**: Use TF-IDF, LDA, and BERT to extract relevant keywords from the README and issues.

### Similarity Index Matching

1. **Vectorize Data**: Transform the preprocessed data into vectors using TF-IDF.
2. **Compute Similarity**: Calculate cosine similarity between user preferences and repository vectors.
3. **Generate Recommendations**: Recommend repositories to users based on the highest similarity scores.
