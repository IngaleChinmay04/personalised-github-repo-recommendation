icheck,drgullin/icheck,7391,"['CSS', 'HTML', 'JavaScript']",[],"# [iCheck plugin]( [1.0.3](#october-10-2020) #### Highly customizable checkboxes and radio buttons for jQuery and Zepto. Refer to the [iCheck website]( for examples. **Note: [iCheck v2.0]( is on the way**, it got a huge performance boost, many new options and methods. It's in a release candidate state, so you may try to use it. Feel free to submit an issue if you find something not working. Features -------- * **Identical inputs across different browsers and devices** both [desktop and mobile](#browser-support) * **Touch devices support** iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Amazon Kindle * **Keyboard accessible inputs** `Tab`, `Spacebar`, `Arrow up/down` and other shortcuts * **Customization freedom** use any HTML and CSS to style inputs (try [6 Retina-ready skins]( * **jQuery and Zepto** JavaScript libraries support from single file * **Screenreader accessible inputs** [ARIA]( attributes for VoiceOver and others * **Lightweight size** 1 kb gzipped ----- * [32 options](#options) to customize checkboxes and radio buttons * [11 callbacks](#callbacks) to handle changes * [9 methods](#methods) to make changes programmatically * Saves changes to original inputs, [works carefully](#initialize) with any selectors How it works ------------ iCheck works with checkboxes and radio buttons like a constructor. **It wraps each input with a div**, which may be customized by you or using one of the [available skins]( You may also place inside that div some HTML code or text using `insert` option. For this HTML: ```html Foo Bar Bar ``` With default options you'll get nearly this: ```html Foo Bar Bar ``` **By default, iCheck doesn't provide any CSS styles for wrapper divs** (if you don't use [skins]( Options ------- These options are default: ```js { // 'checkbox' or 'radio' to style only checkboxes or radio buttons, both by default handle: '', // base class added to customized checkboxes checkboxClass: 'icheckbox', // base class added to customized radio buttons radioClass: 'iradio', // class added on checked state (input.checked = true) checkedClass: 'checked', // if not empty, used instead of 'checkedClass' option (input type specific) checkedCheckboxClass: '', checkedRadioClass: '', // if not empty, added as class name on unchecked state (input.checked = false) uncheckedClass: '', // if not empty, used instead of 'uncheckedClass' option (input type specific) uncheckedCheckboxClass: '', uncheckedRadioClass: '', // class added on disabled state (input.disabled = true) disabledClass: 'disabled', // if not empty, used instead of 'disabledClass' option (input type specific) disabledCheckboxClass: '', disabledRadioClass: '', // if not empty, added as class name on enabled state (input.disabled = false) enabledClass: '', // if not empty, used instead of 'enabledClass' option (input type specific) enabledCheckboxClass: '', enabledRadioClass: '', // class added on indeterminate state (input.indeterminate = true) indeterminateClass: 'indeterminate', // if not empty, used instead of 'indeterminateClass' option (input type specific) indeterminateCheckboxClass: '', indeterminateRadioClass: '', // if not empty, added as class name on determinate state (input.indeterminate = false) determinateClass: '', // if not empty, used instead of 'determinateClass' option (input type specific) determinateCheckboxClass: '', determinateRadioClass: '', // class added on hover state (pointer is moved onto input) hoverClass: 'hover', // class added on focus state (input has gained focus) focusClass: 'focus', // class added on active state (mouse button is pressed on input) activeClass: 'active', // adds hoverClass to customized input on label hover and labelHoverClass to label on input hover labelHover: true, // class added to label if labelHover set to true labelHoverClass: 'hover', // increase clickable area by given % (negative number to decrease) increaseArea: '', // true to set 'pointer' CSS cursor over enabled inputs and 'default' over disabled cursor: false, // set true to inherit original input's class name inheritClass: false, // if set to true, input's id is prefixed with 'iCheck-' and attached inheritID: false, // set true to activate ARIA support aria: false, // add HTML code or text inside customized input insert: '' } ``` There's no need to copy and paste all of them, you can just mention the ones you need: ```js $('input').iCheck({ labelHover: false, cursor: true }); ``` You can choose any class names and style them as you want. Initialize ---------- Just include `icheck.js` after [jQuery v1.7+]( (or [Zepto]( [polyfill, event, data]). iCheck supports any selectors, but handles only checkboxes and radio buttons: ```js // customize all inputs (will search for checkboxes and radio buttons) $('input').iCheck(); // handle inputs only inside $('.block') $('.block input').iCheck(); // handle only checkboxes inside $('.test') $('.test input').iCheck({ handle: 'checkbox' }); // handle .vote class elements (will search inside the element, if it's not an input) $('.vote').iCheck(); // you can also change options after inputs are customized $('input.some').iCheck({ // different options }); ``` Indeterminate --------- HTML5 allows specifying [indeterminate]( (""partially"" checked) state for checkboxes. iCheck supports this for both checkboxes and radio buttons. You can make an input indeterminate through HTML using additional attributes (supported by iCheck). Both do the same job, but `indeterminate=""true""` may not work in some browsers (like IE7): ```html indeterminate=""true"" determinate=""false"" ``` `indeterminate` and `determinate` [methods](#methods) can be used to toggle indeterminate state. Callbacks --------- iCheck provides plenty callbacks, which may be used to handle changes. Callback name When used ifClicked user clicked on a customized input or an assigned label ifChanged input's ""checked"", ""disabled"" or ""indeterminate"" state is changed ifChecked input's state is changed to ""checked"" ifUnchecked ""checked"" state is removed ifToggled input's ""checked"" state is changed ifDisabled input's state is changed to ""disabled"" ifEnabled ""disabled"" state is removed ifIndeterminate input's state is changed to ""indeterminate"" ifDeterminate ""indeterminate"" state is removed ifCreated input is just customized ifDestroyed customization is just removed Use `on()` method to bind them to inputs: ```js $('input').on('ifChecked', function(event){ alert(event.type + ' callback'); }); ``` `ifCreated` callback should be binded before plugin init. Methods ------- These methods can be used to make changes programmatically (any selectors can be used): ```js // change input's state to 'checked' $('input').iCheck('check'); // remove 'checked' state $('input').iCheck('uncheck'); // toggle 'checked' state $('input').iCheck('toggle'); // change input's state to 'disabled' $('input').iCheck('disable'); // remove 'disabled' state $('input').iCheck('enable'); // change input's state to 'indeterminate' $('input').iCheck('indeterminate'); // remove 'indeterminate' state $('input').iCheck('determinate'); // apply input changes, which were done outside the plugin $('input').iCheck('update'); // remove all traces of iCheck $('input').iCheck('destroy'); ``` You may also specify some function, that will be executed on each method call: ```js $('input').iCheck('check', function(){ alert('Well done, Sir'); }); ``` Feel free to fork and submit pull-request or submit an issue if you find something not working. Comparison ---------- iCheck is created to avoid routine of reinventing the wheel when working with checkboxes and radio buttons. It provides an expected identical result for the huge number of browsers, devices and their versions. Callbacks and methods can be used to easily handle and make changes at customized inputs. There are some CSS3 ways available to style checkboxes and radio buttons, like [this one]( You have to know about some of the disadvantages of similar methods: * inputs are keyboard inaccessible, since `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` used to hide them * poor browser support * multiple bugs on mobile devices * tricky, harder to maintain CSS code * JavaScript is still needed to fix specific issues While CSS3 method is quite limited solution, iCheck is made to be an everyday replacement covering most of the tasks. Browser support --------------- iCheck is verified to work in Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 2+, Opera 9+, Google Chrome and Safari browsers. Should also work in many others. Mobile browsers (like Opera mini, Chrome mobile, Safari mobile, Android browser, Silk and others) are also supported. Tested on iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod), Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone devices. Changelog --------------- ## October 10, 2020 * iOS 13 support @markusbroman * Reformatted changelog @lasseeee * Fire change event when toggled @rafatmyo ### March 03, 2014 * Better HiDPI screens support @ddctd143 ### January 23, 2014 ([v2.0 release candidate]( * Three ways to set an options: global object (`window.icheck`), data attributes (`<input data-checkedClass=""checked""`) and direct JavaScript object (`$(input).icheck({ options })`) * Huge performance boost (takes less than 1s to customize 1000 inputs) * Minimized number of function calls (some slow jQuery functions are replaced with a faster vanilla alternatives without using any dependencies) * AMD module definition support (both for jQuery and Zepto) * Unblocked native events - iCheck 2.x doesn't stop your newly or past binded events from being processed * Pointer events support - full support for phones and tablets that use Windows OS (such as Lumia, HP tablets, desktops with a touch screen, etc) * WebOS and Firefox OS support * New methods: `$(input).icheck('data')` to get all the options were used for customization (also stores a current states values - `checked`, `disabled` and `indeterminate`), `$('input').icheck('styler')` to get a wrapper div (that's used for customization) * Better handling of the `indeterminate` state * Ability to set callbacks in three ways: global object, direct JavaScript object or using bind method (`$(input).on(callback)`) * Ability to switch off some of the callbacks when you don't need them (global or per input) * Inline styles dropped - iCheck won't add any inline styles to the elements until it's highly needed (`cursor` or `area` option) * Fast click support - removes a 300ms click delay on mobile devices without any dependencies (iCheck compatible with the `fastclick` plugin), see the `tap` option * Ability to ignore customization for the selected inputs using `init` option (if set to `false`) * Optimized event bindings - iCheck binds only a few global events for the all inputs (doesn't increase on elements addition), instead of a couple for the each customized element * Doesn't store tons of arbitrary data (event in jQuery or Zepto cache), defines customized elements by specific classnames * Extra `ins` tag is dropped (less DOM modifications), iCheck wraps each input with a single `div` and doesn't use any extra markup for the any option * Optimized reflows and repaints on init and state changes * Better options handling - iCheck will never run a single line of JS to process an options that are off or empty * Ability to auto customize the ajax loaded inputs without using any extra code (`autoAjax` option, on by default) * Auto inits on domready using the specified selector (`autoInit` option) - searches for `.icheck` by default. Classnames can be changed using the `window.classes` object * Memory usage optimization - uses only a few amount of memory (works well on low-memory devices) * Betters callbacks architecture - these are fired only after changes are applied to the input * Ability to set a mirror classes between the inputs and assigned labels using the `hoverLabelClass`, `focusLabelClass`, `activeLabelClass`, `checkedLabelClass`, `disabledLabelClass` and `indeterminateLabelClass` options (`mirror` option should be set to `true` to make this happen) * Fixes some issues of the mobile devices * Fixes the issues of the wrapper labels, that loose a click ability in some browsers (if no `for` attribute is set) * Some other options and improvements * Various bug fixes Note: extended docs and usage examples will be available later. ### December 19, 2013 * Added Bower support * Added to jQuery plugin registry ### December 18, 2013 * Added ARIA attributes support (for VoiceOver and others) @myfreeweb * Added Amazon Kindle support @skinofstars * Fixed clickable links inside labels @LeGaS * Fixed lines separation between labels and inputs * Merged two versions of the plugin (jQuery and Zepto) into one * Fixed demo links * Fixed callbacks @PepijnSenders License ------- iCheck plugin is released under the [MIT License]( Feel free to use it in personal and commercial projects.","1.6k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Security, Insights, enhancements, questions, features, bugs, skins, incorrect"

spring-petclinic,spring-projects/spring-petclinic,7303,"['CSS', 'Java', 'HTML']",[],"# Spring PetClinic Sample Application []( []( []( ## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams [See the presentation here]( ## Run Petclinic locally Spring Petclinic is a [Spring Boot]( application built using [Maven]( or [Gradle]( You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer): ```bash git clone cd spring-petclinic ./mvnw package java -jar target/*.jar ``` You can then access the Petclinic at . Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this, it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this): ```bash ./mvnw spring-boot:run ``` > NOTE: If you prefer to use Gradle, you can build the app using `./gradlew build` and look for the jar file in `build/libs`. ## Building a Container There is no `Dockerfile` in this project. You can build a container image (if you have a docker daemon) using the Spring Boot build plugin: ```bash ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image ``` ## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic Our issue tracker is available [here]( ## Database configuration In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is exposed at ` and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:` URL. The UUID is printed at startup to the console. A similar setup is provided for MySQL and PostgreSQL if a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type changes, the app needs to run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySQL or `spring.profiles.active=postgres` for PostgreSQL. You can start MySQL or PostgreSQL locally with whatever installer works for your OS or use docker: ```bash docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:8.4 ``` or ```bash docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=petclinic -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=petclinic -e POSTGRES_DB=petclinic -p 5432:5432 postgres:16.3 ``` Further documentation is provided for [MySQL]( and [PostgreSQL]( Instead of vanilla `docker` you can also use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start the database containers. Each one has a profile just like the Spring profile: ```bash docker-compose --profile mysql up ``` or ```bash docker-compose --profile postgres up ``` ## Test Applications At development time we recommend you use the test applications set up as `main()` methods in `PetClinicIntegrationTests` (using the default H2 database and also adding Spring Boot Devtools), `MySqlTestApplication` and `PostgresIntegrationTests`. These are set up so that you can run the apps in your IDE to get fast feedback and also run the same classes as integration tests against the respective database. The MySql integration tests use Testcontainers to start the database in a Docker container, and the Postgres tests use Docker Compose to do the same thing. ## Compiling the CSS There is a `petclinic.css` in `src/main/resources/static/resources/css`. It was generated from the `petclinic.scss` source, combined with the [Bootstrap]( library. If you make changes to the `scss`, or upgrade Bootstrap, you will need to re-compile the CSS resources using the Maven profile ""css"", i.e. `./mvnw package -P css`. There is no build profile for Gradle to compile the CSS. ## Working with Petclinic in your IDE ### Prerequisites The following items should be installed in your system: - Java 17 or newer (full JDK, not a JRE) - [Git command line tool]( - Your preferred IDE - Eclipse with the m2e plugin. Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in `Help -> About` dialog. If m2e is not there, follow the install process [here]( - [Spring Tools Suite]( (STS) - [IntelliJ IDEA]( - [VS Code]( ### Steps 1. On the command line run: ```bash git clone ``` 1. Inside Eclipse or STS: Open the project via `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project`, then select the root directory of the cloned repo. Then either build on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or use the Eclipse launcher (right-click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the CSS. Run the application's main method by right-clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`. 1. Inside IntelliJ IDEA: In the main menu, choose`File -> Open` and select thePetclinic [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button. - CSS files are generated from the Maven build. You can build them on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or right-click on the `spring-petclinic` project then `Maven -> Generates sources and Update Folders`. - A run configuration named `PetClinicApplication` should have been created for you if you're using a recent Ultimate version. Otherwise, run the application by right-clicking on the `PetClinicApplication` main class and choosing `Run 'PetClinicApplication'`. 1. Navigate to the Petclinic Visit [ in your browser. ## Looking for something in particular? |Spring Boot Configuration | Class or Java property files | |--------------------------|---| |The Main Class | [PetClinicApplication]( | |Properties Files | [application.properties]( | |Caching | [CacheConfiguration]( | ## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks The Spring Petclinic ""main"" branch in the [spring-projects]( GitHub org is the ""canonical"" implementation based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are [quite a few forks]( in the GitHub org [spring-petclinic]( If you are interested in using a different technology stack to implement the Pet Clinic, please join the community there. ## Interaction with other open-source projects One of the best parts about working on the Spring Petclinic application is that we have the opportunity to work in direct contact with many Open Source projects. We found bugs/suggested improvements on various topics such as Spring, Spring Data, Bean Validation and even Eclipse! In many cases, they've been fixed/implemented in just a few days. Here is a list of them: | Name | Issue | |------|-------| | Spring JDBC: simplify usage of NamedParameterJdbcTemplate | [SPR-10256]( and [SPR-10257]( | | Bean Validation / Hibernate Validator: simplify Maven dependencies and backward compatibility |[HV-790]( and [HV-792]( | | Spring Data: provide more flexibility when working with JPQL queries | [DATAJPA-292]( | ## Contributing The [issue tracker]( is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests and submitting pull requests. For pull requests, editor preferences are available in the [editor config](.editorconfig) for easy use in common text editors. Read more and download plugins at .

DataTables,DataTables/DataTables,7284,"['CSS', 'JavaScript']",[],"# Legacy repository Please note that this is a **legacy repo** for DataTables. The main source repo [is DataTables/DataTablesSrc]( Our distribution repos (for NPM, Nuget, etc packages) are the `DataTables/Dist-*` repos - e.g. [DataTables/Dist-DataTables]( Each distribution repo has a core Javascript file or styling for DataTables or an extension. Please use our [download builder]( to obtain the files you need, including for NPM, Nuget, CDN and download. # DataTables plug-in for jQuery DataTables is a table enhancing plug-in for the [jQuery](//jquery.com) Javascript library, adding sorting, paging and filtering abilities to plain HTML tables with minimal effort. The stated goal of DataTables is: > To enhance the accessibility of data in HTML tables. To meet this goal, DataTables is developed with two distinct groups of users in mind: * You the developers using DataTables. For developers DataTables provides a wide array of options for how data should be obtained, displayed and acted upon, along with an extensive API for accessing and manipulating the table. * End users. For those using the interface DataTables presents, actions to get the most from the information contained in tables, such as sorting and filtering, along with paging and scrolling of the data in table, are easy to use, intuitive and fast. ## Installing DataTables To use DataTables, the primary way to obtain the software is to use the [DataTables downloader](//datatables.net/download). You can also include the individual files from the [DataTables CDN](//cdn.datatables.net). See the [documentation](//datatables.net/manual/installation) for full details. ### NPM and Bower If you prefer to use a package manager such as NPM or Bower, distribution repositories are available with software built from this repository under the name `datatables.net`. Styling packages for Bootstrap, Foundation and other styling libraries are also available by adding a suffix to the package name. Please see the DataTables [NPM](//datatables.net/download/npm) and [Bower](//datatables.net/download/bower) installation pages for further information. The [DataTables installation manual](//datatables.net/manual/installation) also has details on how to use package managers with DataTables. ## Usage In its simplest case, DataTables can be initialised with a single line of Javascript: ```js $('table').dataTable(); ``` where the jQuery selector is used to obtain a reference to the table you want to enhance with DataTables. Optional configuration parameters can be passed in to DataTables to have it perform certain actions by using a configuration object as the parameter passed in to the DataTables constructor. For example: ```js $('table').dataTable( { paginate: false, scrollY: 300 } ); ``` will disable paging and enable scrolling. A full list of the options available for DataTables are available in the [documentation](//datatables.net). ## Documentation Full documentation of the DataTables options, API and plug-in interface are available on the [DataTables web-site](//datatables.net).

css-loaders,lukehaas/css-loaders,7041,"['CSS', 'Less', 'SCSS']",[],"# [Single Element CSS Spinners]( This is a collection of loading spinners animated with CSS. Each spinner consists of a single `div` with a class of `loader` and content text of ""Loading..."". The text is for screen readers and can be used as a fallback state for older browsers. The aim of this project was to create a set of minimal loading spinners that are visually appealing and also convey their intended meaning. A strict limit of one element per loader (not including pseudo-elements) was placed on this project based on the belief that something as simple as a loader doesn't deserve more. Each loader is given a font size in pixels and all other sizes are in ems so to change the size of a loader, just adjust the font-size. ## Demo []( > [Check it live]( ## Browser Support | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | IE 10+ | Chrome 4.0+ | Firefox 16.0+ | Opera 15.0+ | Safari 4.0+ | ## Contributing 1.

weather-icons,erikflowers/weather-icons,6869,"['CSS', 'HTML', 'Less']",[],"# Weather Icons ## 222 Weather Themed Icons and CSS Weather Icons is the only icon font and CSS with 222 weather themed icons, ready to be dropped right into [Bootstrap]( or any project that needs high quality weather, maritime, and meteorological based icons! Get started at [ ## Basic Usage Place the 5 font files and the main `weather-icons.min.css` file in your project, with the assumption that the fonts are located up `../` from your CSS directory. The icons are displayed by using an `i` element and adding the base class `wi` and then the icon class you want, such as `day-sunny`. This then looks like ``. To add a modifier, include the class you want after the icon name, which looks like ``. You can flip, rotate, or add a fixed width. See it all at [ ## API Usage This set includes companion CSS files for popular weather service API. Presently there are mappings for Forecast.io, Open Weather Map, World Meteorological Organization, Weather Underground, and Yahoo. Check the [API List]( to see the class names. ## Wind Usage To use the wind indicators, you must also use `weather-icons-wind.min.css` along with the default CSS file. To display a wind indicator, you must use the base class `wi` and `wi-wind`, and then include the towards/from direction you want, like `from-293-deg`. This ends up looking like . You can use any degree from 0 to 359 in this manner. **Note:** A ""from"" class has the point of the arrow at the opposite end of the degree. For example, a ""from 90 degrees"" icon would point to the 270 degree mark, wheras a ""towards 270 degrees"" would point at the same 270 degree mark. Included in the set as well are aliases to point to cardinal directions. They work the same as degrees, for example `` would be an arrow pointing to the South by Southeast (roughly 158 degrees). ## Contributing If you feel so inclined to add icon ideas, icon art, or other fixes/changes to how the package works, feel free to help! ## Credit The icon designs are originally by [Lukas Bischoff]( Icon art for v1.1 forward, HTML, Less, and CSS are by [me (Erik)]( ## Licensing * Weather Icons licensed under [SIL OFL 1.1]( * Code licensed under [MIT License]( * Documentation licensed under [CC BY 3.0](","849, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, new icon, enhancement, question, bug, wontfix, invalid, duplicate"

Exposed,JetBrains/Exposed,7960,['Kotlin'],"['kotlin', 'sql', 'dao', 'orm']","[]( []( []( []( []( ## Welcome to **Exposed**, an ORM framework for [Kotlin]( Exposed is a lightweight SQL library on top of a JDBC driver for the Kotlin language. Exposed has two flavors of database access: typesafe SQL wrapping DSL and lightweight Data Access Objects (DAO). With Exposed, you have two options for database access: wrapping DSL and a lightweight DAO. Our official mascot is the cuttlefish, which is well-known for its outstanding mimicry ability that enables it to blend seamlessly into any environment. Similar to our mascot, Exposed can be used to mimic a variety of database engines, which helps you to build applications without dependencies on any specific database engine and to switch between them with very little or no changes. ## Supported Databases - H2 (versions 2.x; 1.x version is deprecated and will be removed in future releases) - []( - []( - []( - []( (Also, PostgreSQL using the [pgjdbc-ng]( JDBC driver) - []( - []( ## Dependencies ### Maven Central configuration Releases of Exposed are available in the Maven Central repository.

Therefore, Google can still access information such as the user's IP address. Aside from that, subscriptions can only be stored locally. LibreTube takes this one step further and proxies all requests via Piped (which uses the NewPipeExtractor). This prevents Google servers from accessing your IP address or any other personal data. Apart from that, Piped allows syncing your subscriptions between LibreTube and Piped, which can be used on desktop too. If the NewPipeExtractor breaks, it only requires an update of Piped and not LibreTube itself. Therefore, fixes usually arrive faster than in NewPipe.

Unciv,yairm210/Unciv,7820,"['Kotlin', 'Dockerfile', 'Shell']","['civilization-v', 'android', 'libgdx', 'civilization', 'game']","# Unciv - Civ V remake for Android & Desktop []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( ## What is this? An open source, moddability-focused Android and Desktop remake of Civ V, made with LibGDX ## Is this any good? Depends what you're looking for. If you're in the market for high-res graphics, amazing soundtracks, animations etc, I highly recommend Firaxis's Civ-V-like game, ""Civilization V"". If you want a small, fast, moddable, FOSS, in-depth 4X that can still run on a potato, you've come to the right place :) ## What's the roadmap? In this order: * Polish! As you may have noticed, Unciv is fully functional but rough around the edges. This means: * UI+UX improvements ([suggestions welcome!]( * Better automation, AI etc. in-game * G&K mechanics - espionage, small other changes (see [#4697]( * BNW mechanics - trade routes, world congress, etc. ## Contributing Programmers start [here]( Translators start [here]( Modders start [here]( You can join us in any of the open issue, or work on improving anything you want - once you're finished, issue a pull request and it'll go into the next version! If not, you can help by spreading the word - vote for Unciv where you can, mention it on Reddit or Twitter etc, and help us with new ideas of how to get the word out! ## FAQ ## How do I install? - **Android** - [Google Play]( or [F-droid]( - **Windows/Linux** - [itch.io]( Flatpak via [Flathub]( or [AUR]( - **Raspberry Pi** - [Pi-apps]( - **MacOS** - Install [with this guide]( - Jars, APKs and Windows/Linux builds also available in [Releases]( (run jar with `java -jar Unciv.jar`) - *not recommended* since we update frequently and you will quickly become out-of-date - [Build from scratch]( if that's your thing ### How about IOS? I'm not planning on it. It means paying money to Apple, yet another release path, and since I don't have an IOS device it means I can't test it properly. ### Steam release? Steam has decided that they don't want to host Unciv, they probably don't want to risk legal issues with Firaxis (although those should be non-existent, see below) ### Will you implement {feature}? If it's in the original Civ V, then yes! If not, then the feature won't be added to the base game - possibly it will be added as a way to mod the game, which is constantly expanding #### Why not? This is its own game, why not add features that weren't in Civ V? Having a clear vision is important for actually getting things done. Anyone can make a suggestion. Not all are good, viable, or simple. Not many can actually implement stuff. As an open source project, this stuff is done in our spare time, of which there isn't much. We need a clear-cut criteria to decide what to work on and what not to work on. #### Will you implement Civ VI? Considering how long it took to get this far, no. ### How can I learn to play? Where's the wiki?

RIBs,uber/RIBs,7692,"['Kotlin', 'Java', 'Swift']","['ios', 'android', 'mobile', 'mobile-app', 'mobile-development']","[]( []( []( []( []( RIBs is the cross-platform architecture framework behind many mobile apps at Uber. The name RIBs is short for Router, Interactor and Builder, which are core components of this architecture. This framework is designed for mobile apps with a large number of engineers and nested states. The RIBs architecture provides: * **Shared architecture across iOS and Android.** Build cross-platform apps that have similar architecture, enabling iOS and Android teams to cross-review business logic code. * **Testability and Isolation.** Classes must be easy to unit test and reason about in isolation. Individual RIB classes have distinct responsibilities like: routing, business, view logic, creation. Plus, most RIB logic is decoupled from child RIB logic. This makes RIB classes easy to test and reason about independently. * **Tooling for developer productivity.** RIBs come with IDE tooling around code generation, memory leak detection, static analysis and runtime integrations - all which improve developer productivity for large teams or small. * **An architecture that scales.** This architecture has proven to scale to hundreds of engineers working on the same codebase and apps with hundreds of RIBs. ## Documentation To get started with RIBs, please refer to the [RIBs documentation]( This describes key concepts on RIBs, from what they are for, their structure and common use cases. To get more hands on with RIBs, we have written a [series of tutorials]( that run you through the main aspects of the architecture with hands-on examples. To read about the backstory on why we created RIBs, see [this blog post]( we wrote when releasing RIBs in production the first time and see [this short video]( where we discussed how the RIBs architecture works. #### What is the difference between RIBs and MV*/VIPER? MVC, MVP, MVI, MVVM and VIPER are architecture patterns. RIBs is a framework. What differentiates RIBs from frameworks based on MV*/VIPER is: - **Business logic drives the app, not the view tree**. Unlike with MV*/VIPER, a RIB does not have to have a view. This means that the app hierarchy is driven by the business logic, not the view tree. - **Independent business logic and view trees**. RIBs decouple how the business logic scopes are structured from view hierarchies. This allows the application to have a deep business logic tree, isolating business logic nodes, while maintaining a shallow view hierarchy making layouts, animations and transitions easy. There are some other novel things about RIBs. However, these could also be implemented with other MV*/VIPER frameworks. These are: - **Cross-platform approach**, allowing iOS and Android architecture to stay in sync. - **Tooling for easier adoption** on larger apps or teams. Tooling we are open sourcing includes IDE plugins for code generation and static code analysis. - **Strong opinions about how state should be communicated**, using DI and Rx. Each RIB defines its dependencies and what dependencies it needs from its parent. Parent components that fulfill a childs parent dependencies are provided to child Builders as a constructor dependency to allow for hierarchical DI scoping. This means that information is communicated via these dependencies up and down the tree. ## Usage 1. Clone this repository 2. Integrate using your preferred installation mechanism For usage of the tooling built around RIBs, please see the [Tooling section]( in our documentation. ## Installation for Android To integrate the recommended minimum setup for RIBs add the following to your `build.gradle`: ```gradle dependencies { annotationProcessor 'com.uber.rib:rib-compiler-test:0.16.2' implementation 'com.uber.rib:rib-android:0.16.2' testImplementation 'com.uber.rib:rib-test:0.16.2' } ``` There are a number of extension packages available as well including Kotlin extensions, Jetpack Compose support, Coroutines support ## Installation for iOS #### CocoaPods To integrate RIBs into your project add the following to your `Podfile`: ```ruby pod 'RIBs', '~> 0.9' ``` #### Carthage To integrate RIBs into your project using Carthage add the following to your `Cartfile`: ```ruby github ""uber/RIBs"" ~> 0.9 ``` ## Related projects If you like RIBs, check out other related open source projects from our team: - [Needle]( a compile-time safe Swift dependency injection framework. - [Motif]( An abstract on top of Dagger offering simpler APIs for nested scopes. - [Swift Concurrency]( a set of concurrency utility classes used by Uber, inspired by the equivalent [java.util.concurrent]( package classes. - [Swift Abstract Class]( a light-weight library along with an executable that enables compile-time safe abstract class development for Swift projects. - [Swift Common]( common libraries used by this set of Swift open source projects. ## License Copyright (C) 2017 Uber Technologies Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License""); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Pokedex,skydoves/Pokedex,7652,['Kotlin'],"['android', 'kotlin', 'pokemon', 'pokedex', 'mvvm']","Pokedex Pokedex demonstrates modern Android development with Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Jetpack (Room, ViewModel), and Material Design based on MVVM architecture. > [!TIP] > If you want to see the Jetpack Compose version of Pokedex, check out the [Pokedex Compose]( repository. ## Download Go to the [Releases]( to download the latest APK. ## Tech stack & Open-source libraries - Minimum SDK level 21 - [Kotlin]( based, [Coroutines]( + [Flow]( for asynchronous. - Jetpack - Lifecycle: Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes. - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. - DataBinding: Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically. - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access. - [Hilt]( for dependency injection. - Architecture - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model) - [Bindables]( Android DataBinding kit for notifying data changes to UI layers. - Repository Pattern - [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3]( Construct the REST APIs and paging network data. - [Sandwich]( Construct a lightweight and modern response interface to handle network payload for Android. - [Moshi]( A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java. - [WhatIf]( Check nullable objects and empty collections more fluently. - [Bundler]( Android Intent & Bundle extensions, which insert and retrieve values elegantly. - [ksp]( Kotlin Symbol Processing API. - [Turbine]( A small testing library for kotlinx.coroutines Flow. - [Material-Components]( Material design components for building ripple animation, and CardView. - [Glide]( [GlidePalette]( Loading images from network. - [TransformationLayout]( Implementing transformation motion animations. - Custom Views - [Rainbow]( An easy way to apply gradations and tinting for Android. - [AndroidRibbon]( A simple way to implement a beautiful ribbon with the shimmering on Android. - [ProgressView]( A polished and flexible ProgressView, fully customizable with animations. - [Timber]( A logger with a small, extensible API. ## Architecture **Pokedex** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows the [Google's official architecture guidance]( The overall architecture of **Pokedex** is composed of two layers; the UI layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they have each different responsibilities, as defined below: **Pokedex** was built with [Guide to app architecture]( so it would be a great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects. ### Architecture Overview - Each layer follows [unidirectional event/data flow]( the UI layer emits user events to the data layer, and the data layer exposes data as a stream to other layers. - The data layer is designed to work independently from other layers and must be pure, which means it doesn't have any dependencies on the other layers. With this loosely coupled architecture, you can increase the reusability of components and scalability of your app. ### UI Layer The UI layer consists of UI elements to configure screens that could interact with users and [ViewModel]( that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes. - UI elements observe the data flow via [DataBinding]( which is the most essential part of the MVVM architecture. - With [Bindables]( which is an Android DataBinding kit for notifying data changes, you can implement two-way binding, and data observation in XML very clean. ### Data Layer The data Layer consists of repositories, which include business logic, such as querying data from the local database and requesting remote data from the network. It is implemented as an offline-first source of business logic and follows the [single source of truth]( principle. **Pokedex** is an offline-first app is an app that is able to perform all, or a critical subset of its core functionality without access to the internet. So users don't need to be up-to-date on the network resources every time and it will decrease users' data consumption. For further information, you can check out [Build an offline-first app]( ## Modularization **Pokedex** adopted modularization strategies below: - **Reusability**: Modulizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time. - **Parallel Building**: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time. - **Strict visibility control**: Modules restrict to expose dedicated components and access to other layers, so it prevents they're being used outside the module - **Decentralized focusing**: Each developer team can assign their dedicated module and they can focus on their own modules. For more information, check out the [Guide to Android app modularization]( ## MAD Score ## Open API Pokedex using the [PokeAPI]( for constructing RESTful API. PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pokmon. ## Find this repository useful? :heart: Support it by joining __[stargazers]( for this repository. :star: Also, __[follow me]( on GitHub for my next creations! # License ```xml Designed and developed by 2022 skydoves (Jaewoong Eum) Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License""); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

In addition to daily habits, Loop supports habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times per week or every other day. * Reminders. Schedule notifications to remind you of your habits. Each habit can have its own reminder, at a chosen time of the day. Easily check or dismiss your habit directly from the notification. * Widgets. Be reminded of your habits whenever you unlock your phone. Colorful widgets allow you to track your habits directly from your home screen, without even opening the app. * Take control of your data. If you want to further analyze your data, or move it to another service, Loop allows you to export it to spreadsheets (CSV) or to a database file (SQLite). For power users, checkmarks can be added through other apps, such as Tasker. * No limitations. Track as many habits as you wish. Loop imposes no artificial limits on how many habits you can have. All features are available to all users. There are no in-app purchases. * Completely ad-free and open source. There are no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The app is completely open-source (GPLv3). * Works offline and respects your privacy. Loop doesn't require an Internet connection or online account registration.

Built by [gskinner]( in partnership with Google, these vignettes range from the practical to the novel. They aim to inspire both developers and designers to build delightful and beautiful experiences with Flutter. In addition to forking and reviewing the [MIT licensed code](LICENSE.md) available here, you can also check out more information on the [Vignette Showcase Website]( ### About gskinner We exist to build inovative digital experiences for smart clients, and we love how easy Flutter makes that. Don't hesitate to [stop by our site]( to learn more about what we do. We'd love to hear from you! ### The Vignettes Travel Cards Use a Stack widget to create a parallax effect inside of a list, while also using a Transform to give it a 3D card effect. View Code Mindfulness Gooey Transition Draw curved vector paths and use them to mask content. Utilizes a small physics simulation to calculate tension between a set of points. View Code Boarding Pass Cards Uses the Transform widget to create a folding card effect. In this case a boarding pass with multiple folds, each fold containing a child widget. View Code Inbox Swipe Particles Demonstrates how you can use particles in your Flutter app and how to tie multiple actions to a list swipe. View Code Icon Flip Button Bar Example of a bespoke NavigationBar with animated buttons that change size, shape, and color when selected. View Code Liquid Rewards Cards Shows how to easily create resizeable list items using AnimatedContainer; also uses the Canvas API to simulate a liquid effect. View Code Dog Toy Slider Use a Flare animation to create a custom Slider control. Creates a custom FlareControl class for playback while the slider itself is painted on a Canvas. View Code Guide To the Stars Particles Shows how to use an animated Canvas as the primary background for your app. In this case, a starfield effect that controls its animation speed based on user scrolling and page transitions. View Code Paris Travel Hero Transition Shows how you can create a custom Hero effect that contains complex animations and retains its state between pages. View Code Fluid Button Bar Uses a Canvas to create a fluid-style navigation bar that has a fun bouncy feel to it; also shows how to use the Path API to draw, and animate some custom icons. View Code Product Zoom Transition Example of an animated png sequence within a Hero animation; also uses a Canvas to render and animate a product detail overlay. View Code Article Dark Mode Shows how a png sequence can be used to mask an arbitrary widget. Here that technique is used in a page transition between light and dark themes. View Code Sports App Pull To Refresh Shows how to create a custom pull to refresh animation. In this example, we used a sprite sequence to render a basketball spinning around the hoop as it loads. View Code Plant Shopping Cart An example of multi-part form validation and the ability to customize the form contents based on the country the user has selected. View Code Feature Artist Carousel Uses a custom 3D model renderer and blending mask to create a fun and unique background effect. View Code Sparkle Party Particles Uses the drawVertices API to draw a ton of particles extremely quickly. The particles are animated using a sprite sheet and comes with 4 different presets. View Code BudgetTracker Graphs Demonstrates how charts and graphs can be implemented using the Canvas API. It also provides an example of arbitrary panning and scrolling in a view. View Code ### Installation If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions]( Once you're set up and can compile the sample Flutter app, you're ready to run some vignettes! Each vignette is stored in its own folder in the repository. Using your IDE of choice, open the vignette directory you'd like to run. Then, using the terminal inside your IDE, run `flutter pub get` to fetch any dependencies, and `flutter run` to deploy to your connected device or simulator. If you would like to try these for Flutter for web, you can use `flutter run -d chrome`. Note that Flutter for web is currently a technical preview and not all of the vignettes will work correctly. For more information on enabling Flutter for web follow the [setup instructions]( ### License These vignettes are released under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). You can use the code for any purpose, including commercial projects.

hive,isar/hive,3894,['Dart'],"['flutter', 'dart', 'key-value', 'nosql', 'encryption']","Fast, Enjoyable & Secure NoSQL Database Hive is a lightweight and buzzing-fast key-value database made for Flutter and Dart. ## Features - Bee everywhere: mobile, desktop, browser - Buzzing speed: Faster than a bee on caffeine! - Sweet, powerful, & intuitive API - Queen's Guard: Encryption built right in. - Thinking in swarms: Multi-isolate support. - Everything a bee needs and more! > Bee fact: A single bee can visit 5,000 flowers in a day! ## Buzz into Action Feeling the excitement? Great! Let's help you take your first flight with Hive. #### Add dependencies To kickstart the journey add `hive`, `isar_flutter_libs` and `path_provider` to your `pubspec.yaml`. ```yaml dependencies: hive: ^4.0.0 isar_flutter_libs: ^4.0.0-dev.13 path_provider: ^2.1.0 ``` Pssst! `path_provider` will help you to find the optimal directory for each platform. #### Designate a Home Hive needs a place to call home. Using `path_provider` we can find a valid directory. ```dart void main() async { WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory(); Hive.defaultDirectory = dir.path; // ... } ``` #### And... Action! Woohoo! You're all set. Jump in and let your Hive adventure begin! ```dart import 'package:hive/hive.dart'; final box = Hive.box(); box.put('name', 'David'); final name = box.get('name'); print('Name: $name'); ``` > Bee fact: Honeybees can fly at a speed of up to 30 kilometers per hour! # Hive Handbook In Hive, data is neatly organized into containers known as boxes. Think of boxes as tables you'd find in SQL, but far more flexible they don't stick to a set structure and can contain a variety of data. Boxes can be encrypted to store sensitive data. ## Table of Contents Want to jump to a specific section? Here's a handy table of contents: - [Opening Boxes](#-opening-boxes) - [Closing Boxes](#-bidding-adieu-closing-boxes) - [Inserting](#-filling-the-honeycomb-inserting-data) - [Reading](#-extracting-honey-i-mean-data) - [Deleting](#-deleting-data) - [Using Boxes like Lists](#-using-boxes-like-lists) - [Type safety](#-type-safety) - [Non-primitive Objects](#-bee-yond-the-basics-non-primitive-objects) - [Transactions](#-transactions) - [Isolates](#-the-isolate-dance) - [FAQ](#-buzzworthy-questions) > Bee fact: Bees have five eyes three simple eyes on top of the head, and two compound eyes, with numerous hexagonal facets. ### Opening Boxes Your journey with Hive begins with opening your first box. Trust me, it's unbee-lievably easy: ```dart final box = Hive.box(name: 'myBox'); ``` When you call `Hive.box(name: 'myBox')` for the first time with a given name, Hive will create a new box for you. If you call it again with the same name, Hive will return the already existing box. You can also use `Hive.box()` without providing a name. In this case, Hive will return the default box. There are optional parameters you can pass to `Hive.box()`: | Parameter | Description | | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | `name` | Label your box with a distinct name | | `directory` | Select a home for your box. If omitted, Hive uses the `defaultDirectory`. | | `encryptionKey` | Hand over this key, and Hive will encrypt your box. Keep it safe! | | `maxSizeMiB` | The maximum size of the box in MiB. Go for a modest number. | > Bee fact: Beeswax, which is secreted from the abdomen of worker bees, is used to construct the honeycomb. ### Bidding Adieu: Closing Boxes It's not advised to close boxes that might be accessed again. This prevents unnecessary overhead of reopening the box and ensures smooth data retrieval. To close a box just call `box.close()`. Wipe the box from the face of the earth with `box.deleteFromDisk()`. > Bee fact: When a bee finds a good source of nectar, it flies back to the hive and shows its friends where the nectar source is by doing a dance. ### Filling the Honeycomb: Inserting Data Once we have a box, it's time to fill it with sweet data! At its core, a box is just a key-value store. String keys are mapped to arbitrary primitive values. You can think of a box as a persisted `Map`. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.put('danceMoves', 'Waggle Dance'); box.put('wingSpeed', 200); ``` Updating values? If a particular key already exists, Hive simply updates its corresponding value. And complex types like lists and maps? They're in too! ```dart box.put('friends', ['Buzzy', 'Stinger', 'Honey']); box.put('memories', {'firstFlight': 'Sunny Day', 'bestNectar': 'Rose'}); ``` Instead of `.put()` you prefer the syntax of maps? Hive gets you: ```dart box['danceMoves'] = 'Round Dance'; box['wingSpeed'] = 220; ``` Got a bucket of honey facts? Drop them all at once with `box.putAll()`: ```dart box.putAll({'favoriteFlower': 'Lavender', 'wingSpeed': 210}); ``` > Bee fact: A single bee colony can produce anywhere from 30 to 100 pounds of honey in a year, depending on the availability of nectar sources. ### Extracting Honey... I mean, Data! Need a snippet of info from your Hive? No need to don the beekeeper suit; just scoop it out using `box.get()` or `box.getAll()`. If a key doesn't exist, `box.get()` simply return a `null`. But fret not; you can tell it to have a backup plan: ```dart final box = Hive.box(name: 'beeees'); final fav = box.get('favoriteFlower'); final moves = box.get('danceMoves', defaultValue: 'waggle'); ``` Oh, and if you're feeling fancy, use the `[]` operator for a more stylish approach: ```dart final fav = box['favoriteFlower']; final moves = box['danceMoves'] ?? 'waggle'; ``` > Bee fact: Worker bees are the only bees most people ever see flying around outside the hive. They're female, and their roles are to forage for food, build and protect the hive, and more. ### Deleting Data Time for some spring cleaning in the hive! To remove a single entry from your box, use `box.delete()`: ```dart final deleted = box.delete('lavenderHoney'); print('Honey eaten: $deleted'); // Honey eaten: true ``` Perhaps it's time for a complete reset, making space for a fresh batch of honey. If you're looking to remove all key-value pairs from a box, use `box.clear()`: ```dart box.clear(); ``` > Bee fact: Bees have been around for more than 30 million years! Their long history predates the existence of humans and even dinosaurs. ### Using Boxes like Lists In the bee world, honeycombs aren't just random compartments; they're methodically organized. Similarly, while we've been viewing Hive boxes as maps so far, they can be used just like lists: ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Rose'); box.add('Tulip'); print(box.getAt(0)); // Rose print(box.getAt(1)); // Tulip ``` But remember, bees can't retrieve honey from a comb that's empty or doesn't exist. Likewise, index-based operations will throw an error if you try an index out of bounds: ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Daisy'); print(box.getAt(1)); // Error! This will make the bees buzz in confusion ``` Even if we insert a key-value pair we can still access the values by index. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Lily'); box.put('key', 'Orchid'); print(box.getAt(0)); // Lily print(box.getAt(1)); // Orchid ``` Of course, we can also use the `[]` operator in combination with indexes : ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.add('Marigold'); print(box[0]); // Marigold box[0] = 'Daffodil'; box[1] = 'Bluebell'; // Error! This will get the bees in a whirl ``` > Bee fact: To produce one pound of honey, a hive's bees must visit 2 million flowers and fly over 55,000 miles. ### Type safety Safety is the bee's priority! To keep your data sweet and pure boxes have an optional generic type parameter. It allows you to store only values of a specific type in a box: ```dart final box = Hive.box(name: 'BeeTreasures'); box.put('DaisyDance', 'SweetNectarShake'); box.put('RoseRumba', 'GoldenPollenParty'); box.put('TulipTango', 777); // Error - You can't fool the bees! ``` Make sure to use the same type whenever you get the box. Otherwise, you'll get an error: ```dart Hive.box(name: 'BeeTreasures'); // Error - We already have a String box! ``` > Bee fact: Bees have two stomachs. One is for eating, and the other is for storing nectar collected from flowers or water so they can carry it back to their hive. Talk about a sweet backpack! ### Bee-yond the Basics: Non-primitive Objects Hive goes beyond storing just basic data types! Along with primitives, lists, and maps, Hive can store any Dart object of your liking. The only buzz you need to know? Your object should come equipped with a `.fromJson()` and `.toJson()` method: ```dart class Bee { Bee({required this.name, required this.role}); factory Bee.fromJson(Map json) => Bee( name: json['name'] as String, role: json['role'] as String, ); final String name; final String role; Map toJson() => { 'name': name, 'role': role, }; } ``` Before our bee-friends can buzz around in Hive, you need to do the beekeeper's job and register the `Bee` class: ```dart Hive.registerAdapter('Bee', Bee.fromJson); ``` Now, you're all set to let your bees fly: ```dart final box = Hive.box(); final bumble = Bee(name: 'Bumble', role: 'Worker'); box.put('BumbleID', bumble); print(box.get('BumbleID')); // Bumble - Worker ``` > Bee fact: Bees are responsible for pollinating about one-third of the world's food crops. ### Transactions Transactions are an efficient way to update multiple values at once. They are also useful if you want to make sure that a Box is not changed by other code while you are working with it. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.write(() { box.store('nectar1', 'GoldenNectar'); box.store('nectar2', 'WildflowerBrew'); box.store('nectar3', 'CloverDew'); }); box.read(() { box.get('nectar1'); // GoldenNectar }); ``` Changes made in a transaction are always atomic. Either all changes are applied or none of them. So if an error occurs during a transaction, the box will not be changed. ```dart final box = Hive.box(); box.put('honeyLevel', 5); box.write(() { box.put('honeyLevel', 6); throw Exception('Oh no!!!'); }); print(box.get('honeyLevel')); // 5 ``` > Bee fact: Bees can recognize human faces, and they can even be trained to associate a picture of a face with sweet treats! ### The Isolate Dance Just like a beehive where multiple bees work simultaneously, you can buzz into Hive from various Isolates at the same time. This nifty trick is great when you wish to keep those database activities separate from your UI thread. Hive comes with a sweet `Hive.compute()` method that runs a function in a different isolate. The best part? It also does the honey-making job of setting up and tidying resources for you. ```dart // Opening the bee's box final box = Hive.box(); // Storing some sweet nectar box.put('nectarType', 'wildflower'); await Hive.compute(() { // Accessing the same box from another worker bee final box = Hive.box(); print(box.get('nectarType')); // wildflower // Updating the nectar's quality box.put('nectarType', 'lavender'); }); // Tasting the updated honey flavor print(honeycomb.get('nectarType')); // lavender ``` Just remember, while the bees dance in harmony, ensure your Isolates do too! > Bee fact: Bees have two pairs of wings, and they beat 11,400 times per minute. ### Buzzworthy Questions #### To bee or not to bee: Hive or Isar? > It's not always black and yellow! Both Hive and Isar have their sweet spots. Hive is a lightweight wrapper around Isar so if you are looking for a simple key-value store, Hive might be enough. Isar is the way to go if you need queries, relations, and more advanced features. #### Will using Hive make my app as fast as a bee? > While we can't promise your app will gain wings, Hive sure will give it the speed it deserves. Hive is very resource efficient and optimized for mobile devices. Flutter like a butterfly, sting like a bee! #### Where in the beehive does Hive hide my honey... I mean, data? > Remember the `defaultDirectory` we set at the beginning? That's where Hive stores your data in a file named `yourBoxName.isar` or `yourBoxName.sqlite`. #### I've got some bee-autiful images! Can I store them directly in Hive? > While you might be tempted to put those pics right into Hive, it's best to store your images and other binary data as files outside Hive. You can then store the file path in Hive. Think of it like leaving honey out in the open; it's better to keep it neatly stored in the appropriate place. #### Yikes! What if my app meets an untimely demise (gets killed)? What becomes of my Hive? > No need for a bee-mergency! If your app buzzes off unexpectedly, Hive ensures that your data remains safe and sound. Transactions are atomic, so either all changes are applied or none of them. If an error occurs during a transaction, the box will not be changed. #### How does Hive keep our data safe from sticky fingers? > We've got the queen's guard on duty! If you encrypt your box Hive uses 256-bit AES in CBC mode. Every database page is safeguarded separately, ensuring your sweet stuff remains secure and only accessible to those with the right key. Buzz-worthy protection, right? #### When should I rally the troops and use transactions? > Just like a hive making big decisions together, you'll want to use transactions when you have several operations that should be executed together. If one fails, they all fail. It ensures your data stays consistent, safe, and buzzing in harmony! #### What if I'm allergic to bees? > No worries! Hive is 100% sting-free, although we're pretty sure you'll get a buzz out of its performance. #### Hive operations are synchronous. Doesn't that make the bee waltz a bit slow? > Hive is incredibly fast and efficient. It's built on top of Isar, a high-performance database engine. If you want to keep database operations away from your UI isolate, you can use `compute()` or `Isolate.run()` to run them in a separate isolate. #### How many boxes should a wise beekeeper have? > While the sky's the limit in the world of bees, in Hive, every box becomes a separate file. So, even if you're buzzing with excitement, it's wise not to overdo it. ### License ``` Copyright 2023 Simon Choi Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the ""License""); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

wsa_pacman,alesimula/wsa_pacman,3805,"['Dart', 'C++', 'CMake']",[],"# wsa_pacman A GUI package manager and package installer for Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA). Currently provides a double-click GUI installer for .apk and .xapk files that shows app information (package, icon, version and permissions), allows normal installations as well as upgrades and downgrades. The app additionally provides a button to open Android settings and one to open the ""Manage Applications"" Android settings page, from which you can uninstall or disable applications and grant or revoke permissions ## Settings - Autostart WSA - on/off - Android port - Default: 58526 - Language - [All options](./locale/) - Theme mode - System - Dark - Light - Window transparency (mica) - Full - Partial - Disabled - Adaptive icon shape - Squircle - Circle - Rounded square - Disabled ## FAQ **Q:** WSA PacMan is always showing the Offline status, why is that? **A:** First things first make sure WSA is installed (duh); Open the 'Windows Subsystem for Android Settings' app, in the Developer tab and make sure the 'Developer mode' switch is enabled; inside manage developer settings, make sure the 'USB debugging' option is enabled. Should all of the above fail, [try following this procedure]( make sure to check the 'always allow' option. ## **Q:** Can I use WSA PacMan on older versions of Windows (eg. Windows 10)? **A:** WSA PacMan depends on Windows Subsystem for Linux, which is only ***officially*** supported on Windows 11. However, you may be able to install WSA on Windows 10 [using this project]( by JimDude7404 and following the step-by-step guide on the GitHub page. ## **Q:** Can i install the Play Store? **A:** The play store is not _officially_ supported on WSA, and at the moment it is only possible to install it using an unofficial WSA build. I recommend installing the [Aurora Store]( instead, which is an unofficial Play Store client; but if you really want the Play Store and other Google apps, [check out this project]( ## More screenshots","823, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, wontfix, question, invalid, help wanted, good first issue, enhancement, duplicate, documentation, bug"
dart-sass,sass/dart-sass,3802,"['Dart', 'HTML', 'Shell']","['sass', 'css-preprocessor', 'dart', 'dart-sass']","A [Dart][dart] implementation of [Sass][sass]. **Sass makes CSS fun**. [dart]: [sass]: * [Using Dart Sass](#using-dart-sass) * [From Chocolatey or Scoop (Windows)](#from-chocolatey-or-scoop-windows) * [From Homebrew (macOS)](#from-homebrew-macos-or-linux) * [Standalone](#standalone) * [From npm](#from-npm) * [Dart Sass in the Browser](#dart-sass-in-the-browser) * [Legacy JavaScript API](#legacy-javascript-api) * [Using Sass with Jest](#using-sass-with-jest) * [From Pub](#from-pub) * [`sass_api` Package](#sass_api-package) * [From Source](#from-source) * [In Docker](#in-docker) * [Why Dart?](#why-dart) * [Compatibility Policy](#compatibility-policy) * [Browser Compatibility](#browser-compatibility) * [Node.js Compatibility](#nodejs-compatibility) * [Invalid CSS](#invalid-css) * [Embedded Dart Sass](#embedded-dart-sass) * [Usage](#usage) * [Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass](#behavioral-differences-from-ruby-sass) ## Using Dart Sass There are a few different ways to install and run Dart Sass, depending on your environment and your needs. ### From Chocolatey or Scoop (Windows) If you use [the Chocolatey package manager]( or [the Scoop package manager]( for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running ```cmd choco install sass ``` or ```cmd scoop install sass ``` That'll give you a `sass` executable on your command line that will run Dart Sass. See [the CLI docs][cli] for details. [cli]: ### From Homebrew (macOS or Linux) If you use [the Homebrew package manager]( you can install Dart Sass by running ```sh brew install sass/sass/sass ``` That'll give you a `sass` executable on your command line that will run Dart Sass. ### Standalone You can download the standalone Dart Sass archive for your operating systemcontaining the Dart VM and the snapshot of the executablefrom [the GitHub release page][]. Extract it, [add the directory to your path][], restart your terminal, and the `sass` executable is ready to run! [the GitHub release page]: [add the directory to your path]: ### From npm Dart Sass is available, compiled to JavaScript, [as an npm package][npm]. You can install it globally using `npm install -g sass` which will provide access to the `sass` executable. You can also add it to your project using `npm install --save-dev sass`. This provides the executable as well as a library: [npm]: ```js const sass = require('sass'); const result = sass.compile(scssFilename); // OR // Note that `compileAsync()` is substantially slower than `compile()`. const result = await sass.compileAsync(scssFilename); ``` See [the Sass website][js api] for full API documentation. [js api]: #### Dart Sass in the Browser The `sass` npm package can also be run directly in the browser. It's compatible with all major web bundlers as long as you disable renaming (such as [`--keep-names`] in esbuild). You can also import it directly from a browser as an ECMAScript Module without any bundling (assuming `node_modules` is served as well): [`--keep-names`]: ```html ``` Or from a CDN: ```html ``` Or even bundled with all its dependencies: ```html ``` Since the browser doesn't have access to the filesystem, the [`compile()`] and `compileAsync()` functions aren't available for it. If you want to load other files, you'll need to pass a [custom importer] to [`compileString()`] or [`compileStringAsync()`]. The [legacy API] is also not supported in the browser. [`compile()`]: [`compileAsync()`]: [custom importer]: [`compileString()`]: [`compileStringAsync()`]: [legacy API]: #legacy-javascript-api #### Legacy JavaScript API Dart Sass also supports an older JavaScript API that's fully compatible with [Node Sass] (with a few exceptions listed below), with support for both the [`render()`] and [`renderSync()`] functions. This API is considered deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0, so it should be avoided in new projects. [Node Sass]: [`render()`]: [`renderSync()`]: Sass's support for the legacy JavaScript API has the following limitations: * Only the `""expanded""` and `""compressed""` values of [`outputStyle`] are supported. * Dart Sass doesn't support the [`precision`] option. Dart Sass defaults to a sufficiently high precision for all existing browsers, and making this customizable would make the code substantially less efficient. * Dart Sass doesn't support the [`sourceComments`] option. Source maps are the recommended way of locating the origin of generated selectors. [`outputStyle`]: [`precision`]: [`sourceComments`]: #### Using Sass with Jest If you're using [Jest] to run your tests, be aware that it has a [longstanding bug] where its default test environment breaks JavaScript's built-in [`instanceof` operator]. Dart Sass's JS package uses `instanceof` fairly heavily, so in order to avoid breaking Sass you'll need to install [`jest-environment-node-single-context`] and add `testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-node-single-context'` to your Jest config. [Jest]: [longstanding bug]: [`instanceof` operator]: [`jest-environment-node-single-context`]: ### From Pub If you're a Dart user, you can install Dart Sass globally using `pub global activate sass`, which will provide a `sass` executable. You can also add it to your pubspec and use it as a library. We strongly recommend importing it with the prefix `sass`: ```dart import 'package:sass/sass.dart' as sass; void main(List args) { print(sass.compile(args.first)); } ``` See [the Dart API docs][api] for details. [api]: #### `sass_api` Package Dart users also have access to more in-depth APIs via the [`sass_api` package]. This provides access to the Sass AST and APIs for resolving Sass loads without running a full compilation. It's separated out into its own package so that it can increase its version number independently of the main `sass` package. [`sass_api` package]: ### From Source Assuming you've already checked out this repository: 1. [Install Dart]( If you download an archive manually rather than using an installer, make sure the SDK's `bin` directory is on your `PATH`. 2. [Install Buf]. This is used to build the protocol buffers for the [embedded compiler]. 3. In this repository, run `dart pub get`. This will install Dart Sass's dependencies. 4. Run `dart run grinder protobuf`. This will download and build the embedded protocol definition. 5. Run `dart bin/sass.dart path/to/file.scss`. [Install Buf]: [embedded compiler]: #embedded-dart-sass That's it! ### In Docker You can install and run Dart Sass within Docker using the following Dockerfile commands: ```Dockerfile # Dart stage FROM bufbuild/buf AS buf FROM dart:stable AS dart # Add your scss files COPY --from=another_stage /app /app # Include Protocol Buffer binary COPY --from=buf /usr/local/bin/buf /usr/local/bin/ WORKDIR /dart-sass RUN git clone . && \ dart pub get && \ dart run grinder protobuf # This is where you run sass.dart on your scss file(s) RUN dart ./bin/sass.dart /app/sass/example.scss /app/public/css/example.css ``` ## Why Dart? Dart Sass has replaced Ruby Sass as the canonical implementation of the Sass language. We chose Dart because it presented a number of advantages: * It's fast. The Dart VM is highly optimized, and getting faster all the time (for the latest performance numbers, see [`perf.md`][perf]). It's much faster than Ruby, and close to par with C++. * It's portable. The Dart VM has no external dependencies and can compile applications into standalone snapshot files, so we can distribute Dart Sass as only three files (the VM, the snapshot, and a wrapper script). Dart can also be compiled to JavaScript, which makes it easy to distribute Sass through npm, which the majority of our users use already. * It's easy to write. Dart is a higher-level language than C++, which means it doesn't require lots of hassle with memory management and build systems. It's also statically typed, which makes it easier to confidently make large refactors than with Ruby. * It's friendlier to contributors. Dart is substantially easier to learn than Ruby, and many Sass users in Google in particular are already familiar with it. More contributors translates to faster, more consistent development. [perf]: ## Compatibility Policy For the most part, Dart Sass follows [semantic versioning][]. We consider all of the following to be part of the versioned API: [semantic versioning]: * The Sass language semantics implemented by Dart Sass. * The Dart API. * The JavaScript API. * The command-line interface. Because Dart Sass has a single version that's shared across the Dart, JavaScript, and standalone distributions, this may mean that we increment the major version number when there are in fact no breaking changes for one or more distributions. However, we will attempt to limit the number of breaking changes we make and group them in as few releases as possible to minimize churn. We strongly encourage users to use [the changelog][] for a full understanding of all the changes in each release. [the changelog]: There is one exception where breaking changes may be made outside of a major version revision. It is occasionally the case that CSS adds a feature that's incompatible with existing Sass syntax in some way. Because Sass is committed to full CSS compatibility, we occasionally need to break compatibility with old Sass code in order to remain compatible with CSS. In these cases, we will first release a version of Sass that emits deprecation warnings for any stylesheets whose behavior will change. Then, at least three months after the release of a version with these deprecation warnings, we will release a minor version with the breaking change to the Sass language semantics. ### Browser Compatibility In general, we consider any change to Dart Sass's CSS output that would cause that CSS to stop working in a real browser to be a breaking change. However, there are some cases where such a change would have substantial benefits and would only negatively affect a small minority of rarely-used browsers. We don't want to have to block such a change on a major version release. As such, if a change would break compatibility with less than 2% of the global market share of browser according to [StatCounter GlobalStats][], we may release a minor version of Dart Sass with that change. [StatCounter GlobalStats]: ### Node.js Compatibility We consider dropping support for a given version of Node.js to be a breaking change *as long as* that version is still supported by Node.js. This means that releases listed as Current, Active LTS, or Maintenance LTS according to [the Node.js release page][]. Once a Node.js version is out of LTS, Dart Sass considers itself free to break support if necessary. [the Node.js release page]: ### Invalid CSS Changes to the behavior of Sass stylesheets that produce invalid CSS output are _not_ considered breaking changes. Such changes are almost always necessary when adding support for new CSS features, and delaying all such features until a new major version would be unduly burdensome for most users. For example, when Sass began parsing `calc()` expressions, the invalid expression `calc(1 +)` became a Sass error where before it was passed through as-is. This was not considered a breaking change, because `calc(1 +)` was never valid CSS to begin with. ## Embedded Dart Sass Dart Sass includes an implementation of the compiler side of the [Embedded Sass protocol]. It's designed to be embedded in a host language, which then exposes an API for users to invoke Sass and define custom functions and importers. [Embedded Sass protocol]: ### Usage * `sass --embedded` starts the embedded compiler and listens on stdin. * `sass --embedded --version` prints `versionResponse` with `id = 0` in JSON and exits. The `--embedded` command-line flag is not available when you install Dart Sass as an [npm package]. No other command-line flags are supported with `--embedded`. [npm package]: #from-npm ## Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass There are a few intentional behavioral differences between Dart Sass and Ruby Sass. These are generally places where Ruby Sass has an undesired behavior, and it's substantially easier to implement the correct behavior than it would be to implement compatible behavior. These should all have tracking bugs against Ruby Sass to update the reference behavior. 1. `@extend` only accepts simple selectors, as does the second argument of `selector-extend()`. See [issue 1599][]. 2. Subject selectors are not supported. See [issue 1126][]. 3. Pseudo selector arguments are parsed as ``s rather than having a more limited custom parsing. See [issue 2120][]. 4. The numeric precision is set to 10. See [issue 1122][]. 5. The indented syntax parser is more flexible: it doesn't require consistent indentation across the whole document. See [issue 2176][]. 6. Colors do not support channel-by-channel arithmetic. See [issue 2144][]. 7. Unitless numbers aren't `==` to unit numbers with the same value. In addition, map keys follow the same logic as `==`-equality. See [issue 1496][]. 8. `rgba()` and `hsla()` alpha values with percentage units are interpreted as percentages. Other units are forbidden. See [issue 1525][]. 9. Too many variable arguments passed to a function is an error. See [issue 1408][]. 10. Allow `@extend` to reach outside a media query if there's an identical `@extend` defined outside that query. This isn't tracked explicitly, because it'll be irrelevant when [issue 1050][] is fixed. 11. Some selector pseudos containing placeholder selectors will be compiled where they wouldn't be in Ruby Sass. This better matches the semantics of the selectors in question, and is more efficient. See [issue 2228][]. 12. The old-style `:property value` syntax is not supported in the indented syntax. See [issue 2245][]. 13. The reference combinator is not supported. See [issue 303][]. 14. Universal selector unification is symmetrical. See [issue 2247][]. 15. `@extend` doesn't produce an error if it matches but fails to unify. See [issue 2250][]. 16. Dart Sass currently only supports UTF-8 documents. We'd like to support more, but Dart currently doesn't support them. See [dart-lang/sdk#11744][], for example.

Zero-config setup, integrated hotreloading, and signals-based state management. Add backend functionality with Server Functions and bundle with our CLI. ```rust fn app() -> Element { let mut count = use_signal(|| 0); rsx! { h1 { ""High-Five counter: {count}"" } button { onclick: move |_| count += 1, ""Up high!"" } button { onclick: move |_| count -= 1, ""Down low!"" } } } ``` ## Unique features: - Cross-platform apps in three lines of code (web, desktop, mobile, server, and more) - [Ergonomic state management]( combines the best of React, Solid, and Svelte - Extremely performant, powered by Rust's fastest wasm-framework [sledgehammer]( - Integrated bundler for deploying to the web, macOS, Linux, and Windows - And more! Read the [take a tour of Dioxus]( ## Instant hot-reloading With one command, `dx serve` and your app is running. Edit your markup and styles and see the results in real time. Rust code hotreloading is not yet 1st class, but possible with [hot-lib-reloader]( ## Bundler for deploying to the web and desktop Simply run `dx bundle` and your app will be built and bundled with maximization optimizations. On the web, take advantage of [`.avif` generation, `.wasm` compression, minification]( and more. Build webapps weighing [less than 50kb]( and desktop/mobile apps less than 15mb. ## Fantastic documentation We've put a ton of effort into building clean, readable, and comprehensive documentation. All html elements and listeners are documented with MDN docs, and our docsite runs continuous integration with Dioxus itself to ensure that the docs are always up to date. Check out the [Dioxus website]( for guides, references, recipes, and more. Fun fact: we use the Dioxus website as a testbed for new diouxs features - [check it out!]( ## Emphasis on developer experience Dioxus prioritizes developer experience, and we've put a ton of effort into end-to-end tooling. We've built a [VSCode extension]( that autoformats your RSX code, converts HTML to RSX, and more. We've also built a very powerful [CLI]( that supports creating new apps, serving them, and cross-platform bundling, with deployment on the roadmap. ## Community Dioxus is a community-driven project, with a very active [Discord]( and [GitHub]( community. We're always looking for help, and we're happy to answer questions and help you get started. [Our SDK]( is community-run and we even have a [GitHub organization]( for the best Dioxus crates that receive free upgrades and support. ## Full-time core team Dioxus has grown from a side project to a small team of fulltime engineers. Thanks to the generous support of FutureWei, Satellite.im, the GitHub Accelerator program, we're able to work on Dioxus full-time. Our long term goal is for Dioxus to become self-sustaining by providing paid high-quality enterprise tools. If your company is interested in adopting Dioxus and would like to work with us, please reach out! ## Supported Platforms Web Tier 1 Support Render directly to the DOM using WebAssembly Pre-render with SSR and rehydrate on the client Simple ""hello world"" at about 50kb, comparable to React Built-in dev server and hot reloading for quick iteration Fullstack Tier 1 Support Suspense, hydration, and server-side rendering Quickly drop in backend functionality with server functions Extractors, middleware, and routing integrations Compatible with desktop and mobile! Desktop Tier 1 Support Render using Webview or - experimentally - with WGPU or Freya (skia) Zero-config setup. Simply `cargo run` or `dx serve` to build your app Full support for native system access without IPC Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. Portable <3mb binaries Liveview Tier 1 Support Render apps - or just a single component - entirely on the server Integrations with popular Rust frameworks like Axum and Warp Extremely low-latency and ability to support 10,000+ simultaneous apps Mobile Tier 2 Support Render using Webview or - experimentally - with WGPU or Skia Support for iOS and Android Currently quite experimental, with lots of improvements coming throughout 2024 Terminal Tier 2 Support Render apps directly into your terminal, similar to ink.js Powered by the familiar flexbox and CSS model of the browser Built-in widgets like text input, buttons, and focus system ## Running the examples The examples in the top level of this repository can be run with `cargo run --example `. However, we encourage you to download the dioxus-cli and run the examples with `dx serve` since many examples also support web. When running for web, you either need to modify the Cargo.toml to disable the default desktop feature, or use ## Dioxus vs other frameworks We love all frameworks and enjoy watching innovation in the Rust ecosystem. In fact, many of our projects are shared with other frameworks. For example, our flex-box library [Taffy]( is used by [Bevy]( [Zed]( [Lapce]( [Iced]( and many more. Dioxus places an emphasis on a few key points that make it different from other frameworks: - **React-like**: we rely on concepts like components, props, and hooks to build UIs, with our state management being closer to Svelte than to SolidJS. - **HTML and CSS**: we lean completely into HTML and CSS, quirks and all. - **Renderer-agnostic**: you can swap out the renderer for any platform you want thanks to [our fast VirtualDOM]( - **Collaborative**: whenever possible, we spin out crates like [Taffy]( [magnanis]( [include_mdbook]( and [blitz]( so the ecosystem can grow together. ### Dioxus vs Tauri Tauri is a framework for building desktop (and soon, mobile) apps where your frontend is written in a web-based framework like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Whenever you need to do native work, you can write Rust functions and call them from your frontend. - **Natively Rust**: Tauri's architecture limits your UI to either JavaScript or WebAssembly. With Dioxus, your Rust code is running natively on the user's machine, letting you do things like spawning threads, accessing the filesystem, without any IPC bridge. This drastically simplifies your app's architecture and makes it easier to build. You can build a Tauri app with Dioxus-Web as a frontend if you'd like. - **Different scopes**: Tauri needs to support JavaScript and its complex build tooling, limiting the scope of what you can do with it. Since Dioxus is exclusively focused on Rust, we're able to provide extra utilities like Server Functions, advanced bundling, and a native renderer. - **Shared DNA**: While Tauri and Dioxus are separate projects, they do share libraries like Tao and Wry: windowing and webview libraries maintained by the Tauri team. ### Dioxus vs Leptos Leptos is a library for building fullstack web-apps, similar to SolidJS and SolidStart. The two libraries share similar goals on the web, but have several key differences: - **Reactivity model**: Leptos uses signals for its underlying reactivity, while Dioxus opts for a VirtualDom and re-renders. While in theory signals are more efficient, in practice, Dioxus' VirtualDom performs little-to-no actual diffing (thanks to our [block-dom inspired templates]( and is [actually faster than Leptos]( - **Control flow**: Because Leptos uses signals for reactivity, you are constrained to Leptos' primitives for things like `for` loops and `if` statements. If you get this wrong, your app will lose reactivity, leading to hard to debug UI issues. With Dioxus, you can use iterators, regular Rust `for` loops and `if` statements, and your app will still be reactive. In practice, a Dioxus component to insert counters into a list might look like this: ```rust fn Counters() -> Element { let mut counters = use_signal(|| vec![0; 10]); rsx! { button { onclick: move |_| counters.push(counters.len()), ""Add Counter"" } ul { for idx in 0..counters.len() { li { button { onclick: move |_| counters.write()[idx] += 1, ""{counters.index(idx)}"" } button { onclick: move |_| { counters.remove(idx); }, ""Remove"" } } } } } } ``` [While in Leptos you would use the `` component.]( ```rust fn Counters() -> impl IntoView { let counters = RwSignal::new(vec![0; 10]); view! { ""Add Counter"" {Memo::new(move |_| counters.with(|n| n[idx]))} ""Remove"" } } ``` - **`Copy` state**: Dioxus 0.1 to 0.4 relied on lifetimes to relax the rules of Rust's borrow checker. This worked well for event handlers, but struggled around async. In Dioxus 0.5, we've switched to a [`Copy` state model]( borrowed from Leptos. - **Different scopes**: Dioxus provides renderers for web, desktop, mobile, LiveView, and more. We also maintain community libraries and a cross-platform SDK. The scope of this work is huge, meaning we've historically released at a slower cadence than Leptos. Leptos focuses on the fullstack web, with features that Dioxus doesn't have like ``-based streaming HTML, islands, `` components, and other web-specific features. Generally, web apps you build with Leptos will have a smaller footprint. - **Different DSLs**: While both frameworks target the web, Dioxus uses its own custom Rust-like DSL for building UIs while Leptos uses a more HTML-like syntax. We chose this to retain compatibility with IDE features like codefolding and syntax highlighting. Generally, Dioxus leans into more ""magic"" with its DSL. For example, dioxus will automatically format strings for you while Leptos can split up strings into static and dynamic segments. ```rust // dioxus rsx! { div { class: ""my-class"", enabled: true, ""Hello, {name}"" } } // leptos view! { ""Hello "" {name} } ``` ### Dioxus vs Yew Yew is a framework for building single-page web apps and initially served as an inspiration for Dioxus. Unfortunately, the architecture of Yew didn't support the various features we wanted, and thus Dioxus was born. - **Single-page apps**: Yew is designed exclusively for single-page web apps and is instrinsically tied to the web platform. Dioxus is fullstack and crossplatform, making it suitable for building web, desktop, mobile, and server apps. - **Developer Tooling**: Dioxus provides a number of utilities like autoformatting, hotreloading, and a bundler. - **Ongoing support**: Dioxus is very actively maintained with new features and bug fixes being added on a daily basis. ### Dioxus vs egui egui is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust powering tools like [Rerun.io]( - **Immediate vs Retained**: egui is designed to be re-rendered on every frame. This is suitable for games and other interactive applications, but it does not retain style and layout state between frames. Dioxus is a retained UI framework, meaning that the UI is built once and then modified between frames. This enables Dioxus to use native web technologies like HTML and CSS with better battery life and performance. - **Customizable**: egui brings its own styling and layout solution while Dioxus expects you to use the built-in HTML and CSS. This enables dioxus apps to use any CSS library like Tailwind or Material UI. - **State management**: egui's state management is based on a single global state object. Dioxus encourages encapsulation of state by using components and props, making components more reusable. ### Dioxus vs Iced Iced is a cross-platform GUI library inspired by Elm. Iced renders natively with WGPU and supports the web using DOM nodes. - **Elm state management**: Iced uses Elm's state management model, which is based on message passing and reducers. This is simply a different state management model than Dioxus and can be rather verbose at times. - **Native Feel**: Since Dioxus uses a webview as its renderer, it automatically gets native text input, paste handling, and other native features like accessibility. Iced's renderer currently doesn't implement these features, making it feel less native. - **WGPU**: Dioxus' WGPU renderer is currently quite immature and not yet reader for production use. Iced's WGPU renderer is much more mature and is being used in production. This enables certain types of apps that need GPU access to be built with Iced that can't currently be built with Dioxus. ### Dioxus vs Electron Dioxus and Electron are two entirely different projects with similar goals. Electron makes it possible for developers to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. - **Lightweight**: Dioxus uses the system's native WebView - or optionally, a WGPU renderer - to render the UI. This makes a typical Dioxus app about 15mb on macOS in comparison to Electron's 100mb. Electron also ships an embedded chromium instance which cannot share system resources with the host OS in the same way as Dioxus. - **Maturity**: Electron is a mature project with a large community and a lot of tooling. Dioxus is still quite young in comparison to Electron. Expect to run into features like deeplinking that require extra work to implement. ## Contributing - Check out the website [section on contributing]( - Report issues on our [issue tracker]( - [Join]( the discord and ask questions! ## License This project is licensed under the [MIT license].

Quick Start Client Libraries Demo Projects Integrations Contact ## Getting Started ### Python ``` pip install qdrant-client ``` The python client offers a convenient way to start with Qdrant locally: ```python from qdrant_client import QdrantClient qdrant = QdrantClient("":memory:"") # Create in-memory Qdrant instance, for testing, CI/CD # OR client = QdrantClient(path=""path/to/db"") # Persists changes to disk, fast prototyping ``` ### Client-Server To experience the full power of Qdrant locally, run the container with this command: ```bash docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant ``` Now you can connect to this with any client, including Python: ```python qdrant = QdrantClient("" # Connect to existing Qdrant instance ``` Before deploying Qdrant to production, be sure to read our [installation]( and [security]( guides. ### Clients Qdrant offers the following client libraries to help you integrate it into your application stack with ease: - Official: - [Go client]( - [Rust client]( - [JavaScript/TypeScript client]( - [Python client]( - [.NET/C# client]( - [Java client]( - Community: - [Elixir]( - [PHP]( - [Ruby]( - [Java]( ### Where do I go from here? - [Quick Start Guide]( - End to End [Colab Notebook]( demo with SentenceBERT and Qdrant - Detailed [Documentation]( are great starting points - [Step-by-Step Tutorial]( to create your first neural network project with Qdrant ## Demo Projects ### Discover Semantic Text Search Unlock the power of semantic embeddings with Qdrant, transcending keyword-based search to find meaningful connections in short texts. Deploy a neural search in minutes using a pre-trained neural network, and experience the future of text search. [Try it online!]( ### Explore Similar Image Search - Food Discovery There's more to discovery than text search, especially when it comes to food. People often choose meals based on appearance rather than descriptions and ingredients. Let Qdrant help your users find their next delicious meal using visual search, even if they don't know the dish's name. [Check it out!]( ### Master Extreme Classification - E-commerce Product Categorization Enter the cutting-edge realm of extreme classification, an emerging machine learning field tackling multi-class and multi-label problems with millions of labels. Harness the potential of similarity learning models, and see how a pre-trained transformer model and Qdrant can revolutionize e-commerce product categorization. [Play with it online!]( More solutions Semantic Text Search Similar Image Search Recommendations Chat Bots Matching Engines Anomaly Detection ## API ### REST Online OpenAPI 3.0 documentation is available [here]( OpenAPI makes it easy to generate a client for virtually any framework or programming language. You can also download raw OpenAPI [definitions]( ### gRPC For faster production-tier searches, Qdrant also provides a gRPC interface. You can find gRPC documentation [here]( ## Features ### Filtering and Payload Qdrant can attach any JSON payloads to vectors, allowing for both the storage and filtering of data based on the values in these payloads. Payload supports a wide range of data types and query conditions, including keyword matching, full-text filtering, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more. Filtering conditions can be combined in various ways, including `should`, `must`, and `must_not` clauses, ensuring that you can implement any desired business logic on top of similarity matching. ### Hybrid Search with Sparse Vectors To address the limitations of vector embeddings when searching for specific keywords, Qdrant introduces support for sparse vectors in addition to the regular dense ones. Sparse vectors can be viewed as an generalisation of BM25 or TF-IDF ranking. They enable you to harness the capabilities of transformer-based neural networks to weigh individual tokens effectively. ### Vector Quantization and On-Disk Storage Qdrant provides multiple options to make vector search cheaper and more resource-efficient. Built-in vector quantization reduces RAM usage by up to 97% and dynamically manages the trade-off between search speed and precision. ### Distributed Deployment Qdrant offers comprehensive horizontal scaling support through two key mechanisms: 1. Size expansion via sharding and throughput enhancement via replication 2. Zero-downtime rolling updates and seamless dynamic scaling of the collections ### Highlighted Features * **Query Planning and Payload Indexes** - leverages stored payload information to optimize query execution strategy. * **SIMD Hardware Acceleration** - utilizes modern CPU x86-x64 and Neon architectures to deliver better performance. * **Async I/O** - uses `io_uring` to maximize disk throughput utilization even on a network-attached storage. * **Write-Ahead Logging** - ensures data persistence with update confirmation, even during power outages. # Integrations Examples and/or documentation of Qdrant integrations: - [Cohere]( ([blogpost on building a QA app with Cohere and Qdrant]( - Use Cohere embeddings with Qdrant - [DocArray]( - Use Qdrant as a document store in DocArray - [Haystack]( - Use Qdrant as a document store with Haystack ([blogpost]( - [LangChain]( ([blogpost]( - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for LangChain. - [LlamaIndex]( - Use Qdrant as a Vector Store with LlamaIndex. - [OpenAI - ChatGPT retrieval plugin]( - Use Qdrant as a memory backend for ChatGPT - [Microsoft Semantic Kernel]( - Use Qdrant as persistent memory with Semantic Kernel ## Contacts - Have questions?

atuin,atuinsh/atuin,18123,"['Rust', 'TypeScript', 'Shell']","['shell', 'rust', 'zsh', 'history', 'fish']","magical shell history [English] | [] Atuin replaces your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records additional context for your commands. Additionally, it provides optional and _fully encrypted_ synchronisation of your history between machines, via an Atuin server. exit code, duration, time and command shown As well as the search UI, it can do things like this: ``` # search for all successful `make` commands, recorded after 3pm yesterday atuin search --exit 0 --after ""yesterday 3pm"" make ``` You may use either the server I host, or host your own! Or just don't use sync at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn't access your data even if I wanted to. And I **really** don't want to. ## Features - rebind `ctrl-r` and `up` (configurable) to a full screen history search UI - store shell history in a sqlite database - back up and sync **encrypted** shell history - the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines - log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc - calculate statistics such as ""most used command"" - old history file is not replaced - quick-jump to previous items with Alt-\ - switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current session, directory, or globally - enter to execute a command, tab to edit ## Documentation - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Install](#install) - [Import]( - [Configuration]( - [Searching history]( - [Cloud history sync]( - [History stats]( - [Self host Atuin server]( - [Key binding]( - [Shell completions]( ## Supported Shells - zsh - bash - fish - nushell - xonsh ## Community ### Forum Atuin has a community forum, please ask here for help and support: ### Discord Atuin also has a community Discord, available [here]( # Quickstart ## With the default sync server This will sign you up for the default sync server, hosted by me. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, so your secrets are safe! Read more below for offline-only usage, or for hosting your own server. ``` # bash/zsh/etc bash <(curl --proto '= --tlsv1.2 -sSf # fish bash (curl --proto '= --tlsv1.2 -sSf | psub) atuin register -u -e atuin import auto atuin sync ``` Then restart your shell! > [!NOTE] > > **For Bash users**: The above sets up `bash-preexec` for necessary hooks, but > `bash-preexec` has limitations.

You can [disable update checks by modifying]( `config.toml`. Then restart your shell! ## Install Packaging status ### Script (recommended) The install script will help you through the setup, ensuring your shell is properly configured. It will also use one of the below methods, preferring the system package manager where possible (pacman, homebrew, etc etc). ``` # do not run this as root, root will be asked for if required bash <(curl ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ### With cargo It's best to use [rustup]( to get setup with a Rust toolchain, then you can run: ``` cargo install atuin ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) #### Daemon Build Dependencies [Protoc]( is required to build the daemon, which is enabled by default. This is because we use protobufs for the message serialization ### Homebrew ``` brew install atuin ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ### MacPorts Atuin is also available in [MacPorts]( ``` sudo port install atuin ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ### Cave Atuin is available in the Exherbo Linux [rust repository]( ``` cave resolve -x repository/rust cave resolve -x atuin ``` ### Nix This repository is a flake, and can be installed using `nix profile`: ``` nix profile install ""github:atuinsh/atuin"" ``` Atuin is also available in [nixpkgs]( ``` nix-env -f '' -iA atuin ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ### Pacman Atuin is available in the Arch Linux [[extra] repository]( ``` pacman -S atuin ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ### Xbps Atuin is available in the Void Linux [repository]( ``` sudo xbps-install atuin ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ### Termux Atuin is available in the Termux package repository: ``` pkg install atuin ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ### From source ``` git clone cd atuin/crates/atuin cargo install --path . ``` And then follow [the shell setup](#shell-plugin) ## Shell plugin Once the binary is installed, the shell plugin requires installing. If you use the install script, this should all be done for you! After installing, remember to restart your shell. ### zsh ``` echo 'eval ""$(atuin init zsh)""' >> ~/.zshrc ``` #### Zinit ```sh zinit load atuinsh/atuin ``` #### Antigen ```sh antigen bundle atuinsh/atuin@main ``` ### bash Atuin works in `bash >= 3.1` when combined with either ble.sh or bash-preexec. We recommend to use Atuin with the recent versions of `bash >= 5`. #### [ble.sh]( Atuin works best in bash when using [ble.sh]( >= 0.4. With ble.sh (>= 0.4) installed, just add atuin to your .bashrc ```bash echo 'eval ""$(atuin init bash)""' >> ~/.bashrc ``` > [!IMPORTANT] > > Please make sure that the above line comes after sourcing ble.sh, so Atuin detects ble.sh. #### [bash-preexec]( [Bash-preexec]( can also be used, but you may experience minor problems of missing commands, ignored `HISTCONTROL`, wrong recorded duration and exit status of some commands. To use bash-preexec, download and initialize it ```bash curl -o ~/.bash-preexec.sh echo '[[ -f ~/.bash-preexec.sh ]] && source ~/.bash-preexec.sh' >> ~/.bashrc ``` Then set up Atuin ```bash echo 'eval ""$(atuin init bash)""' >> ~/.bashrc ``` > [!NOTE] > > bash-preexec cannot properly invoke the `preexec` hook for subshell commands > `(...)`, function definitions `func() { ...; }`, empty for-in-statements `for > i in; do ...; done`, etc., so those commands may not be recorded in the > Atuin's history. > > bash-preexec currently has an issue where it will stop honoring > `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace`.

RustPython,RustPython/RustPython,17796,"['Rust', 'Python', 'JavaScript']","['rust', 'python3', 'python-language', 'jit', 'interpreter']","# [RustPython]( A Python-3 (CPython >= 3.12.0) Interpreter written in Rust :snake: :scream: :metal:. []( []( []( []( [][discord] []( []( []( []( []( ## Usage **Check out our [online demo]( running on WebAssembly.** RustPython requires Rust latest stable version (e.g 1.67.1 at February 7th 2023). If you don't currently have Rust installed on your system you can do so by following the instructions at [rustup.rs]( To check the version of Rust you're currently running, use `rustc --version`. If you wish to update, `rustup update stable` will update your Rust installation to the most recent stable release. To build RustPython locally, first, clone the source code: ```bash git clone ``` Then you can change into the RustPython directory and run the demo (Note: `--release` is needed to prevent stack overflow on Windows): ```bash $ cd RustPython $ cargo run --release demo_closures.py Hello, RustPython! ``` Or use the interactive shell: ```bash $ cargo run --release Welcome to rustpython >>>>> 2+2 4 ``` NOTE: For windows users, please set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` environment variable as `Lib` path in project directory. (e.g. When RustPython directory is `C:\RustPython`, set `RUSTPYTHONPATH` as `C:\RustPython\Lib`) You can also install and run RustPython with the following: ```bash $ cargo install --git $ rustpython Welcome to the magnificent Rust Python interpreter >>>>> ``` If you'd like to make requests, you can enable the `ssl` feature, which also lets you install the `pip` package manager. Note that on Windows, you may need to install OpenSSL, or you can enable the `ssl-vendor` feature instead, which compiles OpenSSL for you but requires a C compiler, perl, and `make`. OpenSSL version 3 is expected and tested in CI. Older versions may not work. Once you've installed rustpython with SSL support, you can install pip by running: ```bash cargo install --git --features ssl rustpython --install-pip ``` You can also install RustPython through the `conda` package manager, though this isn't officially supported and may be out of date: ```bash conda install rustpython -c conda-forge rustpython ``` ### WASI You can compile RustPython to a standalone WebAssembly WASI module so it can run anywhere. Build ```bash cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --no-default-features --features freeze-stdlib,stdlib --release ``` Run by wasmer ```bash wasmer run --dir `pwd` -- target/wasm32-wasi/release/rustpython.wasm `pwd`/extra_tests/snippets/stdlib_random.py ``` Run by wapm ```bash $ wapm install rustpython $ wapm run rustpython >>>>> 2+2 4 ``` #### Building the WASI file You can build the WebAssembly WASI file with: ```bash cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi --features=""freeze-stdlib"" ``` > Note: we use the `freeze-stdlib` to include the standard library inside the binary. You also have to run once `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`. ### JIT (Just in time) compiler RustPython has a **very** experimental JIT compiler that compile python functions into native code. #### Building By default the JIT compiler isn't enabled, it's enabled with the `jit` cargo feature. ```bash cargo run --features jit ``` This requires autoconf, automake, libtool, and clang to be installed. #### Using To compile a function, call `__jit__()` on it. ```python def foo(): a = 5 return 10 + a foo.__jit__() # this will compile foo to native code and subsequent calls will execute that native code assert foo() == 15 ``` ## Embedding RustPython into your Rust Applications Interested in exposing Python scripting in an application written in Rust, perhaps to allow quickly tweaking logic where Rust's compile times would be inhibitive? Then `examples/hello_embed.rs` and `examples/mini_repl.rs` may be of some assistance. ## Disclaimer RustPython is in development, and while the interpreter certainly can be used in interesting use cases like running Python in WASM and embedding into a Rust project, do note that RustPython is not totally production-ready. Contribution is more than welcome! See our contribution section for more information on this. ## Conference videos Checkout those talks on conferences: - [FOSDEM 2019]( - [EuroPython 2018]( ## Use cases Although RustPython is a fairly young project, a few people have used it to make cool projects: - [GreptimeDB]( an open-source, cloud-native, distributed time-series database. Using RustPython for embedded scripting. - [pyckitup]( a game engine written in rust. - [Robot Rumble]( an arena-based AI competition platform - [Ruff]( an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust ## Goals - Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings) - A clean implementation without compatibility hacks ## Documentation Currently along with other areas of the project, documentation is still in an early phase. You can read the [online documentation]( for the latest release, or the [user guide]( You can also generate documentation locally by running: ```shell cargo doc # Including documentation for all dependencies cargo doc --no-deps --all # Excluding all dependencies ``` Documentation HTML files can then be found in the `target/doc` directory or you can append `--open` to the previous commands to have the documentation open automatically on your default browser. For a high level overview of the components, see the [architecture](architecture/architecture.md) document. ## Contributing Contributions are more than welcome, and in many cases we are happy to guide contributors through PRs or on Discord. Please refer to the [development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) as well for tips on developments. With that in mind, please note this project is maintained by volunteers, some of the best ways to get started are below: Most tasks are listed in the [issue tracker]( Check issues labeled with [good first issue]( if you wish to start coding. To enhance CPython compatibility, try to increase unittest coverage by checking this article: [How to contribute to RustPython by CPython unittest]( Another approach is to checkout the source code: builtin functions and object methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute. You can also simply run `./whats_left.py` to assist in finding any unimplemented method. ## Compiling to WebAssembly [See this doc](wasm/README.md) ## Community [][discord] Chat with us on [Discord][discord]. ## Code of conduct Our code of conduct [can be found here](code-of-conduct.md). ## Credit The initial work was based on [windelbouwman/rspython]( and [shinglyu/RustPython]( [discord]: ## Links These are some useful links to related projects: - - - ## License This project is licensed under the MIT license.

incubator-seata,apache/incubator-seata,24990,"['Java', 'ANTLR', 'TypeScript']","['tcc', 'saga', 'xa', 'at', 'consistency']","# Seata: Simple Extensible Autonomous Transaction Architecture []( []( []( []( ## What is Seata? A **distributed transaction solution** with high performance and ease of use for **microservices** architecture. ### Distributed Transaction Problem in Microservices Let's imagine a traditional monolithic application. Its business is built up with 3 modules. They use a single local data source. Naturally, data consistency will be guaranteed by the local transaction. Things have changed in a microservices architecture. The 3 modules mentioned above are designed to be 3 services on top of 3 different data sources ([Pattern: Database per service]( Data consistency within every single service is naturally guaranteed by the local transaction. **But how about the whole business logic scope?** ### How Seata do? Seata is just a solution to the problem mentioned above. Firstly, how to define a **Distributed Transaction**? We say, a **Distributed Transaction** is a **Global Transaction** which is made up with a batch of **Branch Transaction**, and normally **Branch Transaction** is just **Local Transaction**. There are three roles in Seata Framework: - **Transaction Coordinator(TC):** Maintain status of global and branch transactions, drive the global commit or rollback. - **Transaction Manager(TM):** Define the scope of global transaction: begin a global transaction, commit or rollback a global transaction. - **Resource Manager(RM):** Manage resources that branch transactions working on, talk to TC for registering branch transactions and reporting status of branch transactions, and drive the branch transaction commit or rollback. A typical lifecycle of Seata managed distributed transaction: 1. TM asks TC to begin a new global transaction. TC generates an XID representing the global transaction. 2. XID is propagated through microservices' invoke chain. 3. RM registers local transaction as a branch of the corresponding global transaction of XID to TC. 4. TM asks TC for committing or rollbacking the corresponding global transaction of XID. 5. TC drives all branch transactions under the corresponding global transaction of XID to finish branch committing or rollbacking. For more details about principle and design, please go to [Seata wiki page]( ### History ##### Alibaba - **TXC**: Taobao Transaction Constructor. Alibaba middleware team started this project since 2014 to meet the distributed transaction problems caused by application architecture change from monolithic to microservices. - **GTS**: Global Transaction Service. TXC as an Aliyun middleware product with new name GTS was published since 2016. - **Fescar**: we started the open source project Fescar based on TXC/GTS since 2019 to work closely with the community in the future. ##### Ant Financial - **XTS**: Extended Transaction Service. Ant Financial middleware team developed the distributed transaction middleware since 2007, which is widely used in Ant Financial and solves the problems of data consistency across databases and services. - **DTX**: Distributed Transaction Extended. Since 2013, XTS has been published on the Ant Financial Cloud, with the name of DTX . ##### Seata Community - **Seata** :Simple Extensible Autonomous Transaction Architecture. Ant Financial joins Fescar, which make it to be a more neutral and open community for distributed transaction, and Fescar be renamed to Seata. ## Maven dependency Depending on the scenario, choose one of the two dependencies: `io.seata:seata-all` or `io.seata:seata-spring-boot-starter`. ```xml 2.0.0 io.seata seata-all ${seata.version} io.seata seata-spring-boot-starter ${seata.version} ``` ## Quick Start [Quick Start]( ## Documentation You can view the full documentation from Seata Official Website: [Seata Website page]( ## Reporting bugs Please follow the [template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.md)for reporting any issues. ## Security Please do not use our public issue tracker but refer to our [security policy](./SECURITY.md) ## Contributing Contributors are welcomed to join the Seata project.

EventBus,greenrobot/EventBus,24599,"['Java', 'CSS']",[],"EventBus ======== [EventBus]( is a publish/subscribe event bus for Android and Java. []( []( EventBus... * simplifies the communication between components * decouples event senders and receivers * performs well with Activities, Fragments, and background threads * avoids complex and error-prone dependencies and life cycle issues * makes your code simpler * is fast * is tiny (~60k jar) * is proven in practice by apps with 1,000,000,000+ installs * has advanced features like delivery threads, subscriber priorities, etc. EventBus in 3 steps ------------------- 1. Define events: ```java public static class MessageEvent { /* Additional fields if needed */ } ``` 2. Prepare subscribers: Declare and annotate your subscribing method, optionally specify a [thread mode]( ```java @Subscribe(threadMode = ThreadMode.MAIN) public void onMessageEvent(MessageEvent event) { // Do something } ``` Register and unregister your subscriber. For example on Android, activities and fragments should usually register according to their life cycle: ```java @Override public void onStart() { super.onStart(); EventBus.getDefault().register(this); } @Override public void onStop() { super.onStop(); EventBus.getDefault().unregister(this); } ``` 3. Post events: ```java EventBus.getDefault().post(new MessageEvent()); ``` Read the full [getting started guide]( There are also some [examples]( **Note:** we highly recommend the [EventBus annotation processor with its subscriber index]( This will avoid some reflection related problems seen in the wild.

Hystrix,Netflix/Hystrix,23914,"['Java', 'Clojure', 'CSS']",[],"# Hystrix: Latency and Fault Tolerance for Distributed Systems []() [![][travis img]][travis] [![][maven img]][maven] [![][license img]][license] # Hystrix Status Hystrix is no longer in active development, and is currently in maintenance mode. Hystrix (at version 1.5.18) is stable enough to meet the needs of Netflix for our existing applications. Meanwhile, our focus has shifted towards more adaptive implementations that react to an applications real time performance rather than pre-configured settings (for example, through [adaptive concurrency limits]( For the cases where something like Hystrix makes sense, we intend to continue using Hystrix for existing applications, and to leverage open and active projects like [resilience4j]( for new internal projects. We are beginning to recommend others do the same. Netflix Hystrix is now officially in maintenance mode, with the following expectations to the greater community: Netflix will no longer actively review issues, merge pull-requests, and release new versions of Hystrix. We have made a final release of Hystrix (1.5.18) per [issue 1891]( so that the latest version in Maven Central is aligned with the last known stable version used internally at Netflix (1.5.11). If members of the community are interested in taking ownership of Hystrix and moving it back into active mode, please reach out to hystrixoss@googlegroups.com. Hystrix has served Netflix and the community well over the years, and the transition to maintenance mode is in no way an indication that the concepts and ideas from Hystrix are no longer valuable. On the contrary, Hystrix has inspired many great ideas and projects. We thank everyone at Netflix, and in the greater community, for all the contributions made to Hystrix over the years. ## Introduction Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable. ## Full Documentation See the [Wiki]( for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information. See the [Javadoc]( for the API. ## Communication - Google Group: [HystrixOSS]( - Twitter: [@HystrixOSS]( - [GitHub Issues]( ## What does it do? #### 1) Latency and Fault Tolerance Stop cascading failures. Fallbacks and graceful degradation. Fail fast and rapid recovery. Thread and semaphore isolation with circuit breakers. #### 2) Realtime Operations Realtime monitoring and configuration changes. Watch service and property changes take effect immediately as they spread across a fleet. Be alerted, make decisions, affect change and see results in seconds. #### 3) Concurrency Parallel execution. Concurrency aware request caching. Automated batching through request collapsing. ## Hello World! Code to be isolated is wrapped inside the run() method of a HystrixCommand similar to the following: ```java public class CommandHelloWorld extends HystrixCommand { private final String name; public CommandHelloWorld(String name) { super(HystrixCommandGroupKey.Factory.asKey(""ExampleGroup"")); this.name = name; } @Override protected String run() { return ""Hello "" + name + ""!""; } } ``` This command could be used like this: ```java String s = new CommandHelloWorld(""Bob"").execute(); Future s = new CommandHelloWorld(""Bob"").queue(); Observable s = new CommandHelloWorld(""Bob"").observe(); ``` More examples and information can be found in the [How To Use]( section. Example source code can be found in the [hystrix-examples]( module. ## Binaries Binaries and dependency information for Maven, Ivy, Gradle and others can be found at [ Change history and version numbers => [CHANGELOG.md]( Example for Maven: ```xml com.netflix.hystrix hystrix-core x.y.z ``` and for Ivy: ```xml ``` If you need to download the jars instead of using a build system, create a Maven pom file like this with the desired version: ```xml 4.0.0 com.netflix.hystrix.download hystrix-download 1.0-SNAPSHOT Simple POM to download hystrix-core and dependencies com.netflix.hystrix hystrix-core x.y.z ``` Then execute: ``` mvn -f download-hystrix-pom.xml dependency:copy-dependencies ``` It will download hystrix-core-*.jar and its dependencies into ./target/dependency/. You need Java 6 or later. ## Build To build: ``` $ git clone git@github.com:Netflix/Hystrix.git $ cd Hystrix/ $ ./gradlew build ``` Further details on building can be found on the [Getting Started]( page of the wiki. ## Run Demo To run a [demo app]( do the following: ``` $ git clone git@github.com:Netflix/Hystrix.git $ cd Hystrix/ ./gradlew runDemo ``` You will see output similar to the following: ``` Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][8ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][20ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][101ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1075ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS][2ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][22ms], GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][130ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1050ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS][4ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][19ms], GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][145ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1301ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][4ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][11ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][93ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1409ms] ##################################################################################### # CreditCardCommand: Requests: 17 Errors: 0 (0%) Mean: 1171 75th: 1391 90th: 1470 99th: 1486 # GetOrderCommand: Requests: 21 Errors: 0 (0%) Mean: 100 75th: 144 90th: 207 99th: 230 # GetUserAccountCommand: Requests: 21 Errors: 4 (19%) Mean: 8 75th: 11 90th: 46 99th: 51 # GetPaymentInformationCommand: Requests: 21 Errors: 0 (0%) Mean: 18 75th: 21 90th: 24 99th: 25 ##################################################################################### Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][10ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][16ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][51ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][922ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][12ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][12ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][68ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1257ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS][10ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][11ms], GetUserAccountCommand[SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][78ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1295ms] Request => GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS][6ms], GetPaymentInformationCommand[SUCCESS][11ms], GetUserAccountCommand[FAILURE, FALLBACK_SUCCESS, RESPONSE_FROM_CACHE][0ms]x2, GetOrderCommand[SUCCESS][153ms], CreditCardCommand[SUCCESS][1321ms] ``` This demo simulates 4 different [HystrixCommand]( implementations with failures, latency, timeouts and duplicate calls in a multi-threaded environment.

I hope you will like it . [Official Website]( | [Manual]( ## Installation Download from [GitHub Releases]( and install it. ### Windows It is recommended to install Motrix using the installation package (Motrix-Setup-x.y.z.exe) to ensure a complete experience, such as associating torrent files, capturing magnet links, etc. If you use package management tools to manage applications on Windows, such as [Chocolatey]( [scoop]( You can use them to install Motrix. #### Chocolatey Thanks to [@Yato]( for continuing to maintain the [Motrix Chocolatey]( package. To install motrix, run the following command from the `command line` or from `PowerShell`: ```bash # Install choco install motrix # Upgrade choco upgrade motrix ``` #### scoop If you prefer the portable version, you can use [scoop]( (need Windows 7+) to install Motrix. ```bash scoop bucket add extras scoop install motrix ``` ### macOS The macOS users can install Motrix using `brew`, thanks to [PR]( of [@Mitscherlich]( ```bash brew update && brew install motrix ``` #### Auto Update Since Motrix v1.8.0 and later versions changed the App BundleID ( `net.agalwood.Motrix` => `app.motrix.native` ), the automatic update of Motrix v1.6.11 will fail. [Motrix Install Assistant]( will help you install the latest Motrix application. ### Linux You can download the `AppImage` (for all Linux distributions) or `snap` to install Motrix, see [GitHub/release]( for more Linux installation package formats. Motrix may need to run with `sudo` for the first time in Linux because there is no permission to create the download session file (`/var/cache/aria2.session`).

In this challenge, you will learn everything you need to be a JavaScript programmer, and in general, the whole concept of programming. In the end of the challenge, you will get a 30DaysOfJavaScript programming challenge completion certificate. In case you need help or if you would like to help others you may join the dedicated [telegram group]( **A 30DaysOfJavaScript** challenge is a guide for both beginners and advanced JavaScript developers. Welcome to JavaScript. JavaScript is the language of the web. I enjoy using and teaching JavaScript and I hope you will do so too. In this step by step JavaScript challenge, you will learn JavaScript, the most popular programming language in the history of mankind. JavaScript is used **_to add interactivity to websites, to develop mobile apps, desktop applications, games_** and nowadays JavaScript can be used for **server-side programming**, **_machine learning_** and **_AI_**. **_JavaScript (JS)_** has increased in popularity in recent years and has been the leading programming language for last ten years and is the most used programming language on GitHub. This challenge is easy to read, written in conversational English, engaging, motivating and at the same time, it is very demanding. You need to allocate much time to finish this challenge. If you are a visual learner, you may get the video lesson on Washera YouTube channel. Subscribe the channel, comment and ask questions on YouTube vides and be proactive, the author will eventually notice you. The author likes to hear your opinion about the challenge, share the author by expressing your thoughts about the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge. You can leave your testimonial on this [link]( ## Requirements No prior knowledge of programming is required to follow this challenge. You need only: 1. Motivation 2. A computer 3. Internet 4. A browser 5. A code editor ## Setup I believe you have the motivation and a strong desire to be a developer, a computer and Internet. If you have those, then you have everything to get started. ### Install Node.js You may not need Node.js right now but you may need it for later. Install [node.js]( After downloading double click and install We can check if node is installed on our local machine by opening our device terminal or command prompt. ```sh asabeneh $ node -v v12.14.0 ``` When making this tutorial I was using Node version 12.14.0, but now the recommended version of Node.js for download is v14.17.6, by the time you use this material you may have a higher Node.js version. ### Browser There are many browsers out there. However, I strongly recommend Google Chrome. #### Installing Google Chrome Install [Google Chrome]( if you do not have one yet. We can write small JavaScript code on the browser console, but we do not use the browser console to develop applications. #### Opening Google Chrome Console You can open Google Chrome console either by clicking three dots at the top right corner of the browser, selecting _More tools -> Developer tools_ or using a keyboard shortcut. I prefer using shortcuts. To open the Chrome console using a keyboard shortcut. ```sh Mac Command+Option+J Windows/Linux: Ctl+Shift+J ``` After you open the Google Chrome console, try to explore the marked buttons. We will spend most of the time on the Console. The Console is the place where your JavaScript code goes. The Google Console V8 engine changes your JavaScript code to machine code. Let us write a JavaScript code on the Google Chrome console: #### Writing Code on Browser Console We can write any JavaScript code on the Google console or any browser console. However, for this challenge, we only focus on Google Chrome console. Open the console using: ```sh Mac Command+Option+I Windows: Ctl+Shift+I ``` ##### Console.log To write our first JavaScript code, we used a built-in function **console.log()**. We passed an argument as input data, and the function displays the output. We passed `'Hello, World'` as input data or argument in the console.log() function. ```js console.log('Hello, World!') ``` ##### Console.log with Multiple Arguments The **`console.log()`** function can take multiple parameters separated by commas. The syntax looks like as follows:**`console.log(param1, param2, param3)`** ```js console.log('Hello', 'World', '!') console.log('HAPPY', 'NEW', 'YEAR', 2020) console.log('Welcome', 'to', 30, 'Days', 'Of', 'JavaScript') ``` As you can see from the snippet code above, _`console.log()`_ can take multiple arguments. Congratulations! You wrote your first JavaScript code using _`console.log()`_. ##### Comments We can add comments to our code. Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this `//` is also a comment. **Example: Single Line Comment** ```js // This is the first comment // This is the second comment // I am a single line comment ``` **Example: Multiline Comment** ```js /* This is a multiline comment Multiline comments can take multiple lines JavaScript is the language of the web */ ``` ##### Syntax Programming languages are similar to human languages. English or many other language uses words, phrases, sentences, compound sentences and other more to convey a meaningful message. The English meaning of syntax is _the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language_. The technical definition of syntax is the structure of statements in a computer language. Programming languages have syntax. JavaScript is a programming language and like other programming languages it has its own syntax. If we do not write a syntax that JavaScript understands, it will raise different types of errors. We will explore different kinds of JavaScript errors later. For now, let us see syntax errors. I made a deliberate mistake. As a result, the console raises syntax errors. Actually, the syntax is very informative. It informs what type of mistake was made. By reading the error feedback guideline, we can correct the syntax and fix the problem. The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called debugging. Let us fix the errors: ```js console.log('Hello, World!') console.log('Hello, World!') ``` So far, we saw how to display text using the _`console.log()`_. If we are printing text or string using _`console.log()`_, the text has to be inside the single quotes, double quotes, or a backtick. **Example:** ```js console.log('Hello, World!') console.log(""Hello, World!"") console.log(`Hello, World!`) ``` #### Arithmetics Now, let us practice more writing JavaScript codes using _`console.log()`_ on Google Chrome console for number data types. In addition to the text, we can also do mathematical calculations using JavaScript. Let us do the following simple calculations. It is possible to write JavaScript code on Google Chrome console can directly without the **_`console.log()`_** function. However, it is included in this introduction because most of this challenge would be taking place in a text editor where the usage of the function would be mandatory. You can play around directly with instructions on the console. ```js console.log(2 + 3) // Addition console.log(3 - 2) // Subtraction console.log(2 * 3) // Multiplication console.log(3 / 2) // Division console.log(3 % 2) // Modulus - finding remainder console.log(3 ** 2) // Exponentiation 3 ** 2 == 3 * 3 ``` ### Code Editor We can write our codes on the browser console, but it won't be for bigger projects. In a real working environment, developers use different code editors to write their codes. In this 30 days of JavaScript challenge, we will be using Visual Studio Code. #### Installing Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code is a very popular open-source text editor. I would recommend to [download Visual Studio Code]( but if you are in favor of other editors, feel free to follow with what you have. If you installed Visual Studio Code, let us start using it. #### How to Use Visual Studio Code Open the Visual Studio Code by double-clicking its icon. When you open it, you will get this kind of interface. Try to interact with the labeled icons. ## Adding JavaScript to a Web Page JavaScript can be added to a web page in three different ways: - **_Inline script_** - **_Internal script_** - **_External script_** - **_Multiple External scripts_** The following sections show different ways of adding JavaScript code to your web page. ### Inline Script Create a project folder on your desktop or in any location, name it 30DaysOfJS and create an **_`index.html`_** file in the project folder. Then paste the following code and open it in a browser, for example [Chrome]( ```html 30DaysOfScript:Inline Script Click Me ``` Now, you just wrote your first inline script. We can create a pop up alert message using the _`alert()`_ built-in function. ### Internal Script The internal script can be written in the _`head`_ or the _`body`_, but it is preferred to put it on the body of the HTML document. First, let us write on the head part of the page. ```html 30DaysOfScript:Internal Script ``` This is how we write an internal script most of the time. Writing the JavaScript code in the body section is the most preferred option. Open the browser console to see the output from the `console.log()`. ```html 30DaysOfScript:Internal Script Click Me ``` Open the browser console to see the output from the `console.log()`. ### External Script Similar to the internal script, the external script link can be on the header or body, but it is preferred to put it in the body. First, we should create an external JavaScript file with .js extension. All files ending with .js extension are JavaScript files. Create a file named introduction.js inside your project directory and write the following code and link this .js file at the bottom of the body. ```js console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript') ``` External scripts in the _head_: ```html 30DaysOfJavaScript:External script ``` External scripts in the _body_: ```html 30DaysOfJavaScript:External script ``` Open the browser console to see the output of the `console.log()`. ### Multiple External Scripts We can also link multiple external JavaScript files to a web page. Create a `helloworld.js` file inside the 30DaysOfJS folder and write the following code. ```js console.log('Hello, World!') ``` ```html Multiple External Scripts ``` _Your main.js file should be below all other scripts_. It is very important to remember this. ## Introduction to Data types In JavaScript and also other programming languages, there are different types of data types. The following are JavaScript primitive data types: _String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null_, and _Symbol_. ### Numbers - Integers: Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ... - Float-point numbers: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ... ### Strings A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. **Example:** ```js 'a' 'Asabeneh' ""Asabeneh"" 'Finland' 'JavaScript is a beautiful programming language' 'I love teaching' 'I hope you are enjoying the first day' `We can also create a string using a backtick` 'A string could be just as small as one character or as big as many pages' 'Any data type under a single quote, double quote or backtick is a string' ``` ### Booleans A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false. A boolean data type is either a true or false value. **Example:** ```js true // if the light is on, the value is true false // if the light is off, the value is false ``` ### Undefined In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined. ```js let firstName console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet ``` ### Null Null in JavaScript means an empty value. ```js let emptyValue = null ``` ## Checking Data Types To check the data type of a certain variable, we use the **typeof** operator. See the following example. ```js console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh') // string console.log(typeof 5) // number console.log(typeof true) // boolean console.log(typeof null) // object type console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined ``` ## Comments Again Remember that commenting in JavaScript is similar to other programming languages. Comments are important in making your code more readable. There are two ways of commenting: - _Single line commenting_ - _Multiline commenting_ ```js // commenting the code itself with a single comment // let firstName = 'Asabeneh'; single line comment // let lastName = 'Yetayeh'; single line comment ``` Multiline commenting: ```js /* let location = 'Helsinki'; let age = 100; let isMarried = true; This is a Multiple line comment */ ``` ## Variables Variables are _containers_ of data. Variables are used to _store_ data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data. To declare a variable, we use _var_, _let_, or _const_ keywords. For a variable that changes at a different time, we use _let_. If the data does not change at all, we use _const_. For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use _const_. We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. It is error prone way of declaring variable it has lots of leak. We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). For now, the above explanation is enough. A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules: - A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number. - A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore. - A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention. - A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words. The following are examples of valid JavaScript variables. ```js firstName lastName country city capitalCity age isMarried first_name last_name is_married capital_city num1 num_1 _num_1 $num1 year2020 year_2020 ``` The first and second variables on the list follows the camelCase convention of declaring in JavaScript. In this material, we will use camelCase variables(camelWithOneHump). We use CamelCase(CamelWithTwoHump) to declare classes, we will discuss about classes and objects in other section. Example of invalid variables: ```js first-name 1_num num_#_1 ``` Let us declare variables with different data types. To declare a variable, we need to use _let_ or _const_ keyword before the variable name. Following the variable name, we write an equal sign (assignment operator), and a value(assigned data). ```js // Syntax let nameOfVariable = value ``` The nameOfVriable is the name that stores different data of value. See below for detail examples. **Examples of declared variables** ```js // Declaring different variables of different data types let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // first name of a person let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // last name of a person let country = 'Finland' // country let city = 'Helsinki' // capital city let age = 100 // age in years let isMarried = true console.log(firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried) ``` ```sh Asabeneh Yetayeh Finland Helsinki 100 true ``` ```js // Declaring variables with number values let age = 100 // age in years const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity in m/s2 const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in C const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant console.log(gravity, boilingPoint, PI) ``` ```sh 9.81 100 3.14 ``` ```js // Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble let name = 'Asabeneh', job = 'teacher', live = 'Finland' console.log(name, job, live) ``` ```sh Asabeneh teacher Finland ``` When you run _index.html_ file in the 01-Day folder you should get this: You are amazing!

It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks. Starting an application in production mode is as easy as: ```bash $ pm2 start app.js ``` PM2 is constantly assailed by [more than 1800 tests]( Official website: [ Works on Linux (stable) & macOS (stable) & Windows (stable). All Node.js versions are supported starting Node.js 12.X. ### Installing PM2 With NPM: ```bash $ npm install pm2 -g ``` You can install Node.js easily with [NVM]( or [FNM]( ### Start an application You can start any application (Node.js, Python, Ruby, binaries in $PATH...) like that: ```bash $ pm2 start app.js ``` Your app is now daemonized, monitored and kept alive forever. ### Managing Applications Once applications are started you can manage them easily: To list all running applications: ```bash $ pm2 list ``` Managing apps is straightforward: ```bash $ pm2 stop $ pm2 restart $ pm2 delete ``` To have more details on a specific application: ```bash $ pm2 describe ``` To monitor logs, custom metrics, application information: ```bash $ pm2 monit ``` [More about Process Management]( ### Cluster Mode: Node.js Load Balancing & Zero Downtime Reload The Cluster mode is a special mode when starting a Node.js application, it starts multiple processes and load-balance HTTP/TCP/UDP queries between them. This increase overall performance (by a factor of x10 on 16 cores machines) and reliability (faster socket re-balancing in case of unhandled errors). Starting a Node.js application in cluster mode that will leverage all CPUs available: ```bash $ pm2 start api.js -i ``` `` can be `'max'`, `-1` (all cpu minus 1) or a specified number of instances to start. **Zero Downtime Reload** Hot Reload allows to update an application without any downtime: ```bash $ pm2 reload all ``` [More informations about how PM2 make clustering easy]( ### Container Support With the drop-in replacement command for `node`, called `pm2-runtime`, run your Node.js application in a hardened production environment. Using it is seamless: ``` RUN npm install pm2 -g CMD [ ""pm2-runtime"", ""npm"", ""--"", ""start"" ] ``` [Read More about the dedicated integration]( ### Host monitoring speedbar PM2 allows to monitor your host/server vitals with a monitoring speedbar. To enable host monitoring: ```bash $ pm2 set pm2:sysmonit true $ pm2 update ``` ### Terminal Based Monitoring Monitor all processes launched straight from the command line: ```bash $ pm2 monit ``` ### Log Management To consult logs just type the command: ```bash $ pm2 logs ``` Standard, Raw, JSON and formated output are available.

One reason we started this project is that we felt that there weren't enough resources for people creating open-source projects. Our goal was to aggregate community best practices, *not* what GitHub (or any other individual or entity) thinks is best. Therefore, we used examples and quotations from others to illustrate our points. ## Contributing This site is powered by [Jekyll]( Check out our [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways to offer feedback and contribute. ## Licenses Content is released under [CC-BY-4.0]( See [notices](notices.md) for complete details, including attribution guidelines, contribution terms, and software and third-party licenses and permissions. ## Acknowledgments The initial release of these guides were authored by **[@nayafia][1], [@bkeepers][2], [@stephbwills][3],** and **[@mlinksva][4]**.

[Read the full Code of Conduct]( The `dev` branch is the default and base branch for the project. It is used for development and all Pull Requests should go there. Please make sure not to commit the `dist` folder in the `dev` branch. #### Development The project needs to be compiled, therefore the files in the `src` folder are those we'll be developing on. Don't make changes in the `dist` or `demo` folders as they will be overwritten when `src` is compiled. 1. Get code ```bash git clone git@github.com:froala/design-blocks.git cd design-blocks ``` 2. Install dependencies and run project ```bash npm install npm run start ``` With the gulp server running, the project is available at the following address [localhost:8001]( The `src` files are automatically compiled when changes have been made. #### Versioning Through the development of new versions, we're going use the Semantic Versioning: Example: 1.0.0. - Major release: increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero. Introduces major changes that might break backward compatibility. E.g. 2.0.0 - Minor release: increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero. It would fix bugs and also add new features without breaking backward compatibility. E.g. 1.1.0 - Patch release: increment the third digit. It would fix bugs and keep backward compatibility. E.g. 1.0.1 ## Contributors Special thanks to everyone who contributed to getting the Froala Design Blocks to the current state. - [Creative Tim]( - design blocks PSDs, help with typography and SVGs for shapes - [Reaction]( - design blocks Sketches: - [m5o]( -help with update to Bootstrap 4 - [Pexels]( - photos - [Undraw]( - illustrations - [FeatherIcons]( - icons ## Copyright and License Code and documentation copyright 2018 [Froala Labs]( Code released under the [Froala Open Web Design License]( Graphics license: - shapes: free to use by [Creative Tim]( - photos: free under the creative license from [Pexels]( - illustrations: free under the creative license from [Undraw]( - icons: free under MIT license [FeatherIcons](","1.3k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, help wanted, enhancement, feature request, integration, good first issue, discuss, dependencies, wontfix, question, invalid, duplicate, deploy, bug"

Yet all of the necessary directories will be read and processed during Jekylls build process. This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files. To install: 1. Add the following to your `Gemfile`: ```ruby gem ""minimal-mistakes-jekyll"" ``` 2. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler]( command: ```bash bundle ``` 3. Set the `theme` in your project's Jekyll `_config.yml` file: ```yaml theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll ``` To update the theme run `bundle update`. ### Remote theme method Remote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require `Gemfile` changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages. To install: 1. Create/replace the contents of your `Gemfile` with the following: ```ruby source "" gem ""github-pages"", group: :jekyll_plugins gem ""jekyll-include-cache"", group: :jekyll_plugins ``` 2. Add `jekyll-include-cache` to the `plugins` array of your `_config.yml`. 3. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler]( command: ```bash bundle ``` 4. Add `remote_theme: ""mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.26.1""` to your `_config.yml` file. Remove any other `theme:` or `remote_theme:` entry. **Looking for an example?** Use the [Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter]( for the quickest method of getting a GitHub Pages hosted site up and running. Generate a new repository from the starter, replace sample content with your own, and configure as needed. ## Usage For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add/migrate content, and more read the [theme's documentation]( ## Contributing Found a typo in the documentation or interested in [fixing a bug]( Then by all means [submit an issue]( or [pull request]( If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow]( first. For help with using the theme or general Jekyll support questions, please use the [Jekyll Talk forums]( ### Pull Requests When submitting a pull request: 1. Clone the repo. 2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`). 3. Open a pull request on GitHub and describe the feature or fix. Theme documentation and demo pages can be found in the [`/docs`](docs) if submitting improvements, typo corrections, etc. ## Development To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`. To test the theme, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at ` This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh. ## Credits ### Creator **Michael Rose** - - - ### Icons + Demo Images: - [The Noun Project]( - Garrett Knoll, Arthur Shlain, and [tracy tam]( - [Font Awesome]( - [Unsplash]( ### Other: - [Jekyll]( - [jQuery]( - [Susy]( - [Breakpoint]( - [Magnific Popup]( - [FitVids.JS]( - [GreedyNav.js]( - [Smooth Scroll]( - [Gumshoe]( - [jQuery throttle / debounce]( - [Lunr]( - [Clipboard.js]( ## License The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2013-2024 Michael Rose and contributors Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the ""Software""), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Its born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design and has been serving sites with tens of millions of users for years. []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( ## What is go-zero? English | [](readme-cn.md) go-zero (listed in CNCF Landscape: [ is a web and rpc framework with lots of builtin engineering practices. Its born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design and has been serving sites with tens of millions of users for years. go-zero contains simple API description syntax and code generation tool called `goctl`. You can generate Go, iOS, Android, Kotlin, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript from .api files with `goctl`. #### Advantages of go-zero: * Improves the stability of the services with tens of millions of daily active users * Builtin chained timeout control, concurrency control, rate limit, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, even no configuration needed * Builtin middlewares also can be integrated into your frameworks * Simple API syntax, one command to generate a couple of different languages * Auto validate the request parameters from clients * Plenty of builtin microservice management and concurrent toolkits ## Backgrounds of go-zero At the beginning of 2018, we decided to re-design our system, from monolithic architecture with Java+MongoDB to microservice architecture. After research and comparison, we chose to: In early 2018, we embarked on a transformative journey to redesign our system, transitioning from a monolithic architecture built with Java and MongoDB to a microservices architecture. After careful research and comparison, we made a deliberate choice to: * Go Beyond with Golang * Great performance * Simple syntax * Proven engineering efficiency * Extreme deployment experience * Less server resource consumption * Self-Design Our Microservice Architecture * Microservice architecture facilitates the creation of scalable, flexible, and maintainable software systems with independent, reusable components. * Easy to locate the problems within microservices. * Easy to extend the features by adding or modifying specific microservices without impacting the entire system. ## Design considerations on go-zero By designing the microservice architecture, we expected to ensure stability, as well as productivity. And from just the beginning, we have the following design principles: * Keep it simple * High availability * Stable on high concurrency * Easy to extend * Resilience design, failure-oriented programming * Try best to be friendly to the business logic development, encapsulate the complexity * One thing, one way After almost half a year, we finished the transfer from a monolithic system to microservice system and deployed on August 2018. The new system guaranteed business growth and system stability. ## The implementation and features of go-zero go-zero is a web and rpc framework that integrates lots of engineering practices. The features are mainly listed below: * Powerful tool included, less code to write * Simple interfaces * Fully compatible with net/http * Middlewares are supported, easy to extend * High performance * Failure-oriented programming, resilience design * Builtin service discovery, load balancing * Builtin concurrency control, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, auto-trigger, auto recover * Auto validation of API request parameters * Chained timeout control * Auto management of data caching * Call tracing, metrics, and monitoring * High concurrency protected As below, go-zero protects the system with a couple of layers and mechanisms: ## The simplified architecture that we use with go-zero ## Installation Run the following command under your project: ```shell go get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero ``` ## Quick Start 1. Full examples can be checked out from below: [Rapid development of microservice systems]( [Rapid development of microservice systems - multiple RPCs]( 2. Install goctl `goctl`can be read as `go control`. `goctl` means not to be controlled by code, instead, we control it. The inside `go` is not `golang`. At the very beginning, I was expecting it to help us improve productivity, and make our lives easier. ```shell # for Go go install github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl@latest # For Mac brew install goctl # docker for amd64 architecture docker pull kevinwan/goctl # run goctl like docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/app kevinwan/goctl --help # docker for arm64(Mac) architecture docker pull kevinwan/goctl:latest-arm64 # run goctl like docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/app kevinwan/goctl:latest-arm64 --help ``` make sure goctl is executable. 3. Create the API file, like greet.api, you can install the plugin of goctl in vs code, api syntax is supported. ```go type ( Request { Name string `path:""name,options=[you,me]""` // parameters are auto validated } Response { Message string `json:""message""` } ) service greet-api { @handler GreetHandler get /greet/from/:name(Request) returns (Response) } ``` the .api files also can be generated by goctl, like below: ```shell goctl api -o greet.api ``` 4. Generate the go server-side code ```shell goctl api go -api greet.api -dir greet ``` the generated files look like: ```Plain Text greet etc greet-api.yaml // configuration file greet.go // main file internal config config.go // configuration definition handler greethandler.go // get/put/post/delete routes are defined here routes.go // routes list logic greetlogic.go // request logic can be written here svc servicecontext.go // service context, mysql/redis can be passed in here types types.go // request/response defined here greet.api // api description file ``` the generated code can be run directly: ```shell cd greet go mod init go mod tidy go run greet.go -f etc/greet-api.yaml ``` by default, its listening on port 8888, while it can be changed in the configuration file. you can check it by curl: ```shell curl -i ``` the response looks like below: ```http HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 30 Aug 2020 15:32:35 GMT Content-Length: 0 ``` 5. Write the business logic code * the dependencies can be passed into the logic within servicecontext.go, like mysql, redis, etc. * add the logic code in a logic package according to .api file 6. Generate code like Java, TypeScript, Dart, JavaScript, etc. just from the api file ```shell goctl api java -api greet.api -dir greet goctl api dart -api greet.api -dir greet ... ``` ## Benchmark [Checkout the test code]( ## Documents * [Documents]( * [Rapid development of microservice systems]( * [Rapid development of microservice systems - multiple RPCs]( * [Examples]( ## Chat group Join the chat via ## Cloud Native Landscape go-zero enlisted in the [CNCF Cloud Native Landscape]( ## Give a Star!

k3s,k3s-io/k3s,26676,"['Go', 'Shell', 'HCL']","['kubernetes', 'k8s']","K3s - Lightweight Kubernetes =============================================== Lightweight Kubernetes. Production ready, easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 100 MB. Great for: * Edge * IoT * CI * Development * ARM * Embedding k8s * Situations where a PhD in k8s clusterology is infeasible What is this? --- K3s is a [fully conformant]( production-ready Kubernetes distribution with the following changes: 1. It is packaged as a single binary. 1. It adds support for sqlite3 as the default storage backend. Etcd3, MySQL, and Postgres are also supported. 1. It wraps Kubernetes and other components in a single, simple launcher. 1. It is secure by default with reasonable defaults for lightweight environments. 1. It has minimal to no OS dependencies (just a sane kernel and cgroup mounts needed). 1. It eliminates the need to expose a port on Kubernetes worker nodes for the kubelet API by exposing this API to the Kubernetes control plane nodes over a websocket tunnel. K3s bundles the following technologies together into a single cohesive distribution: * [Containerd]( & [runc]( * [Flannel]( for CNI * [CoreDNS]( * [Metrics Server]( * [Traefik]( for ingress * [Klipper-lb]( as an embedded service load balancer provider * [Kube-router]( netpol controller for network policy * [Helm-controller]( to allow for CRD-driven deployment of helm manifests * [Kine]( as a datastore shim that allows etcd to be replaced with other databases * [Local-path-provisioner]( for provisioning volumes using local storage * [Host utilities]( such as iptables/nftables, ebtables, ethtool, & socat These technologies can be disabled or swapped out for technologies of your choice. Additionally, K3s simplifies Kubernetes operations by maintaining functionality for: * Managing the TLS certificates of Kubernetes components * Managing the connection between worker and server nodes * Auto-deploying Kubernetes resources from local manifests in realtime as they are changed. * Managing an embedded etcd cluster Current Status -------------- []( []( []( []( What's with the name? -------------------- We wanted an installation of Kubernetes that was half the size in terms of memory footprint. Kubernetes is a 10 letter word stylized as k8s. So something half as big as Kubernetes would be a 5 letter word stylized as K3s. There is neither a long-form of K3s nor official pronunciation. Is this a fork? --------------- No, it's a distribution. A fork implies continued divergence from the original. This is not K3s's goal or practice. K3s explicitly intends not to change any core Kubernetes functionality. We seek to remain as close to upstream Kubernetes as possible. However, we maintain a small set of patches (well under 1000 lines) important to K3s's use case and deployment model. We maintain patches for other components as well. When possible, we contribute these changes back to the upstream projects, for example, with [SELinux support in containerd]( This is a common practice amongst software distributions. K3s is a distribution because it packages additional components and services necessary for a fully functional cluster that go beyond vanilla Kubernetes. These are opinionated choices on technologies for components like ingress, storage class, network policy, service load balancer, and even container runtime. These choices and technologies are touched on in more detail in the [What is this?](#what-is-this) section. How is this lightweight or smaller than upstream Kubernetes? --- There are two major ways that K3s is lighter weight than upstream Kubernetes: 1. The memory footprint to run it is smaller 2. The binary, which contains all the non-containerized components needed to run a cluster, is smaller The memory footprint is reduced primarily by running many components inside of a single process. This eliminates significant overhead that would otherwise be duplicated for each component. The binary is smaller by removing third-party storage drivers and cloud providers, explained in more detail below. What have you removed from upstream Kubernetes? --- This is a common point of confusion because it has changed over time. Early versions of K3s had much more removed than the current version. K3s currently removes two things: 1. In-tree storage drivers 1. In-tree cloud provider Both of these have out-of-tree alternatives in the form of [CSI]( and [CCM]( which work in K3s and which upstream is moving towards. We remove these to achieve a smaller binary size. They can be removed while remaining conformant because neither affects core Kubernetes functionality. They are also dependent on third-party cloud or data center technologies/services, which may not be available in many K3s' use cases. What's next? --- Check out our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what we have planned moving forward. Release cadence --- K3s maintains pace with upstream Kubernetes releases. Our goal is to release patch releases within one week, and new minors within 30 days. Our release versioning reflects the version of upstream Kubernetes that is being released. For example, the K3s release [v1.27.4+k3s1]( maps to the `v1.27.4` Kubernetes release. We add a postfix in the form of `+k3s` to allow us to make additional releases using the same version of upstream Kubernetes while remaining [semver]( compliant. For example, if we discovered a high severity bug in `v1.27.4+k3s1` and needed to release an immediate fix for it, we would release `v1.27.4+k3s2`. Documentation ------------- Please see [the official docs site]( for complete documentation. Quick-Start - Install Script -------------- The `install.sh` script provides a convenient way to download K3s and add a service to systemd or openrc. To install k3s as a service, run: ```bash curl -sfL | sh - ``` A kubeconfig file is written to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` and the service is automatically started or restarted. The install script will install K3s and additional utilities, such as `kubectl`, `crictl`, `k3s-killall.sh`, and `k3s-uninstall.sh`, for example: ```bash sudo kubectl get nodes ``` `K3S_TOKEN` is created at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` on your server. To install on worker nodes, pass `K3S_URL` along with `K3S_TOKEN` environment variables, for example: ```bash curl -sfL | K3S_URL= K3S_TOKEN=XXX sh - ``` Manual Download --------------- 1. Download `k3s` from latest [release]( x86_64, armhf, arm64 and s390x are supported. 1. Run the server. ```bash sudo k3s server & # Kubeconfig is written to /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml sudo k3s kubectl get nodes # On a different node run the below. NODE_TOKEN comes from # /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on your server sudo k3s agent --server --token ${NODE_TOKEN} ``` Contributing ------------ Please check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in contributing to K3s.

croc,schollz/croc,26545,"['Go', 'Shell', 'Makefile']","['file-sharing', 'tcp', 'golang', 'peer-to-peer', 'data-transfer']","This project is supported by Github sponsors. `croc` is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, *croc* is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does **all** of the following: - allows **any two computers** to transfer data (using a relay) - provides **end-to-end encryption** (using PAKE) - enables easy **cross-platform** transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac) - allows **multiple file** transfers - allows **resuming transfers** that are interrupted - local server or port-forwarding **not needed** - **ipv6-first** with ipv4 fallback - can **use proxy**, like tor For more information about `croc`, see [my blog post]( or read a [recent interview I did]( ## Install Download [the latest release for your system]( or install a release from the command-line: ``` curl | bash ``` On macOS you can install the latest release with [Homebrew]( ``` brew install croc ``` On macOS you can also install the latest release with [MacPorts]( ``` sudo port selfupdate sudo port install croc ``` On Windows you can install the latest release with [Scoop]( [Chocolatey]( or [Winget]( ``` scoop install croc ``` ``` choco install croc ``` ``` winget install schollz.croc ``` On Unix you can install the latest release with [Nix]( ``` nix-env -i croc ``` On Alpine Linux you have to install dependencies first: ``` apk add bash coreutils wget -qO- | bash ``` On Arch Linux you can install the latest release with `pacman`: ``` pacman -S croc ``` On Fedora you can install with `dnf`: ``` dnf install croc ``` On Gentoo you can install with `portage`: ``` emerge net-misc/croc ``` On Termux you can install with `pkg`: ``` pkg install croc ``` On FreeBSD you can install with `pkg`: ``` pkg install croc ``` Or, you can [install Go]( and build from source (requires Go 1.17+): ``` go install github.com/schollz/croc/v10@latest ``` On Android there is a 3rd party F-Droid app [available to download]( ## Usage To send a file, simply do: ``` $ croc send [file(s)-or-folder] Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB) Code is: code-phrase ``` Then to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do ``` croc code-phrase ``` The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement ([PAKE]( which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption. There are a number of configurable options (see `--help`). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using `--remember`. ### Custom code phrase You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters). ``` croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder] ``` ### Allow overwriting without prompt By default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the `--overwrite` flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite: ``` croc --yes --overwrite ``` ### Use pipes - stdin and stdout You can pipe to `croc`: ``` cat [filename] | croc send ``` In this case `croc` will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like ""croc-stdin-123456789"". To receive to `stdout` at you can always just use the `--yes` will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to `stdout`. ``` croc --yes [code-phrase] > out ``` All of the other text printed to the console is going to `stderr` so it will not interfere with the message going to `stdout`. ### Send text Sometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with `croc`: ``` croc send --text ""hello world"" ``` This will automatically tell the receiver to use `stdout` when they receive the text so it will be displayed. ### Use a proxy You can use a proxy as your connection to the relay by adding a proxy address with `--socks5`. For example, you can send via a tor relay: ``` croc --socks5 ""127.0.0.1:9050"" send SOMEFILE ``` ### Change encryption curve You can choose from several different elliptic curves to use for encryption by using the `--curve` flag. Only the recipient can choose the curve. For example, receive a file using the P-521 curve: ``` croc --curve p521 ``` Available curves are P-256, P-348, P-521 and SIEC. P-256 is the default curve. ### Change hash algorithm You can choose from several different hash algorithms. The default is the `xxhash` algorithm which is fast and thorough. If you want to optimize for speed you can use the `imohash` algorithm which is even faster, but since it samples files (versus reading the whole file) it can mistakenly determine that a file is the same on the two computers transferring - though this is only a problem if you are syncing files versus sending a new file to a computer. ``` croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE ``` ### Self-host relay The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. By default, `croc` uses a public relay but you can also run your own relay: ``` croc relay ``` By default it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. Make sure to open those up. You can customize the ports (e.g. `croc relay --ports 1111,1112`), but you must have a minimum of **2** ports for the relay. The first port is for communication and the subsequent ports are used for the multiplexed data transfer. You can send files using your relay by entering `--relay` to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own. ``` croc --relay ""myrelay.example.com:9009"" send [filename] ``` Note, when sending, you only need to include the first port (the communication port). The subsequent ports for data transfer will be transmitted back to the user from the relay. #### Self-host relay (docker) If it's easier you can also run a relay with Docker: ``` docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc ``` Be sure to include the password for the relay otherwise any requests will be rejected. ``` croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay ""myreal.example.com:9009"" send [filename] ``` Note: when including `--pass YOURPASSWORD` you can instead pass a file with the password, e.g. `--pass FILEWITHPASSWORD`. ## License MIT ## Acknowledgements `croc` has gone through many iterations, and I am awed by all the great contributions!

Share your thoughts here: > > **Thank you!** []( []( []( []( []( []( **Go configuration with fangs!** Many Go projects are built using Viper including: * [Hugo]( * [EMC RexRay]( * [Imgurs Incus]( * [Nanobox]( * [Docker Notary]( * [BloomApi]( * [doctl]( * [Clairctl]( * [Mercure]( * [Meshery]( * [Bearer]( * [Coder]( * [Vitess]( ## Install ```shell go get github.com/spf13/viper ``` **Note:** Viper uses [Go Modules]( to manage dependencies. ## What is Viper? Viper is a complete configuration solution for Go applications including [12-Factor apps]( It is designed to work within an application, and can handle all types of configuration needs and formats. It supports: * setting defaults * reading from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile and Java properties config files * live watching and re-reading of config files (optional) * reading from environment variables * reading from remote config systems (etcd or Consul), and watching changes * reading from command line flags * reading from buffer * setting explicit values Viper can be thought of as a registry for all of your applications configuration needs. ## Why Viper? When building a modern application, you dont want to worry about configuration file formats; you want to focus on building awesome software. Viper is here to help with that. Viper does the following for you: 1. Find, load, and unmarshal a configuration file in JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile or Java properties formats. 2. Provide a mechanism to set default values for your different configuration options. 3. Provide a mechanism to set override values for options specified through command line flags. 4. Provide an alias system to easily rename parameters without breaking existing code. 5. Make it easy to tell the difference between when a user has provided a command line or config file which is the same as the default. Viper uses the following precedence order. Each item takes precedence over the item below it: * explicit call to `Set` * flag * env * config * key/value store * default **Important:** Viper configuration keys are case insensitive. There are ongoing discussions about making that optional. ## Putting Values into Viper ### Establishing Defaults A good configuration system will support default values. A default value is not required for a key, but its useful in the event that a key hasn't been set via config file, environment variable, remote configuration or flag. Examples: ```go viper.SetDefault(""ContentDir"", ""content"") viper.SetDefault(""LayoutDir"", ""layouts"") viper.SetDefault(""Taxonomies"", map[string]string{""tag"": ""tags"", ""category"": ""categories""}) ``` ### Reading Config Files Viper requires minimal configuration so it knows where to look for config files. Viper supports JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile and Java Properties files. Viper can search multiple paths, but currently a single Viper instance only supports a single configuration file. Viper does not default to any configuration search paths leaving defaults decision to an application. Here is an example of how to use Viper to search for and read a configuration file. None of the specific paths are required, but at least one path should be provided where a configuration file is expected. ```go viper.SetConfigName(""config"") // name of config file (without extension) viper.SetConfigType(""yaml"") // REQUIRED if the config file does not have the extension in the name viper.AddConfigPath(""/etc/appname/"") // path to look for the config file in viper.AddConfigPath(""$HOME/.appname"") // call multiple times to add many search paths viper.AddConfigPath(""."") // optionally look for config in the working directory err := viper.ReadInConfig() // Find and read the config file if err != nil { // Handle errors reading the config file panic(fmt.Errorf(""fatal error config file: %w"", err)) } ``` You can handle the specific case where no config file is found like this: ```go if err := viper.ReadInConfig(); err != nil { if _, ok := err.(viper.ConfigFileNotFoundError); ok { // Config file not found; ignore error if desired } else { // Config file was found but another error was produced } } // Config file found and successfully parsed ``` *NOTE [since 1.6]:* You can also have a file without an extension and specify the format programmatically. For those configuration files that lie in the home of the user without any extension like `.bashrc` ### Writing Config Files Reading from config files is useful, but at times you want to store all modifications made at run time. For that, a bunch of commands are available, each with its own purpose: * WriteConfig - writes the current viper configuration to the predefined path, if exists. Errors if no predefined path. Will overwrite the current config file, if it exists. * SafeWriteConfig - writes the current viper configuration to the predefined path. Errors if no predefined path. Will not overwrite the current config file, if it exists. * WriteConfigAs - writes the current viper configuration to the given filepath. Will overwrite the given file, if it exists. * SafeWriteConfigAs - writes the current viper configuration to the given filepath. Will not overwrite the given file, if it exists. As a rule of the thumb, everything marked with safe won't overwrite any file, but just create if not existent, whilst the default behavior is to create or truncate. A small examples section: ```go viper.WriteConfig() // writes current config to predefined path set by 'viper.AddConfigPath()' and 'viper.SetConfigName' viper.SafeWriteConfig() viper.WriteConfigAs(""/path/to/my/.config"") viper.SafeWriteConfigAs(""/path/to/my/.config"") // will error since it has already been written viper.SafeWriteConfigAs(""/path/to/my/.other_config"") ``` ### Watching and re-reading config files Viper supports the ability to have your application live read a config file while running. Gone are the days of needing to restart a server to have a config take effect, viper powered applications can read an update to a config file while running and not miss a beat. Simply tell the viper instance to watchConfig. Optionally you can provide a function for Viper to run each time a change occurs. **Make sure you add all of the configPaths prior to calling `WatchConfig()`** ```go viper.OnConfigChange(func(e fsnotify.Event) { fmt.Println(""Config file changed:"", e.Name) }) viper.WatchConfig() ``` ### Reading Config from io.Reader Viper predefines many configuration sources such as files, environment variables, flags, and remote K/V store, but you are not bound to them. You can also implement your own required configuration source and feed it to viper. ```go viper.SetConfigType(""yaml"") // or viper.SetConfigType(""YAML"") // any approach to require this configuration into your program. var yamlExample = []byte(` Hacker: true name: steve hobbies: - skateboarding - snowboarding - go clothing: jacket: leather trousers: denim age: 35 eyes : brown beard: true `) viper.ReadConfig(bytes.NewBuffer(yamlExample)) viper.Get(""name"") // this would be ""steve"" ``` ### Setting Overrides These could be from a command line flag, or from your own application logic. ```go viper.Set(""Verbose"", true) viper.Set(""LogFile"", LogFile) viper.Set(""host.port"", 5899) // set subset ``` ### Registering and Using Aliases Aliases permit a single value to be referenced by multiple keys ```go viper.RegisterAlias(""loud"", ""Verbose"") viper.Set(""verbose"", true) // same result as next line viper.Set(""loud"", true) // same result as prior line viper.GetBool(""loud"") // true viper.GetBool(""verbose"") // true ``` ### Working with Environment Variables Viper has full support for environment variables. This enables 12 factor applications out of the box. There are five methods that exist to aid working with ENV: * `AutomaticEnv()` * `BindEnv(string...) : error` * `SetEnvPrefix(string)` * `SetEnvKeyReplacer(string...) *strings.Replacer` * `AllowEmptyEnv(bool)` _When working with ENV variables, its important to recognize that Viper treats ENV variables as case sensitive._ Viper provides a mechanism to try to ensure that ENV variables are unique. By using `SetEnvPrefix`, you can tell Viper to use a prefix while reading from the environment variables. Both `BindEnv` and `AutomaticEnv` will use this prefix. `BindEnv` takes one or more parameters. The first parameter is the key name, the rest are the name of the environment variables to bind to this key. If more than one are provided, they will take precedence in the specified order. The name of the environment variable is case sensitive. If the ENV variable name is not provided, then Viper will automatically assume that the ENV variable matches the following format: prefix + ""_"" + the key name in ALL CAPS. When you explicitly provide the ENV variable name (the second parameter), it **does not** automatically add the prefix. For example if the second parameter is ""id"", Viper will look for the ENV variable ""ID"". One important thing to recognize when working with ENV variables is that the value will be read each time it is accessed. Viper does not fix the value when the `BindEnv` is called. `AutomaticEnv` is a powerful helper especially when combined with `SetEnvPrefix`. When called, Viper will check for an environment variable any time a `viper.Get` request is made. It will apply the following rules. It will check for an environment variable with a name matching the key uppercased and prefixed with the `EnvPrefix` if set. `SetEnvKeyReplacer` allows you to use a `strings.Replacer` object to rewrite Env keys to an extent. This is useful if you want to use `-` or something in your `Get()` calls, but want your environmental variables to use `_` delimiters. An example of using it can be found in `viper_test.go`. Alternatively, you can use `EnvKeyReplacer` with `NewWithOptions` factory function. Unlike `SetEnvKeyReplacer`, it accepts a `StringReplacer` interface allowing you to write custom string replacing logic. By default empty environment variables are considered unset and will fall back to the next configuration source. To treat empty environment variables as set, use the `AllowEmptyEnv` method. #### Env example ```go SetEnvPrefix(""spf"") // will be uppercased automatically BindEnv(""id"") os.Setenv(""SPF_ID"", ""13"") // typically done outside of the app id := Get(""id"") // 13 ``` ### Working with Flags Viper has the ability to bind to flags. Specifically, Viper supports `Pflags` as used in the [Cobra]( library. Like `BindEnv`, the value is not set when the binding method is called, but when it is accessed. This means you can bind as early as you want, even in an `init()` function. For individual flags, the `BindPFlag()` method provides this functionality. Example: ```go serverCmd.Flags().Int(""port"", 1138, ""Port to run Application server on"") viper.BindPFlag(""port"", serverCmd.Flags().Lookup(""port"")) ``` You can also bind an existing set of pflags (pflag.FlagSet): Example: ```go pflag.Int(""flagname"", 1234, ""help message for flagname"") pflag.Parse() viper.BindPFlags(pflag.CommandLine) i := viper.GetInt(""flagname"") // retrieve values from viper instead of pflag ``` The use of [pflag]( in Viper does not preclude the use of other packages that use the [flag]( package from the standard library. The pflag package can handle the flags defined for the flag package by importing these flags. This is accomplished by a calling a convenience function provided by the pflag package called AddGoFlagSet(). Example: ```go package main import ( ""flag"" ""github.com/spf13/pflag"" ) func main() { // using standard library ""flag"" package flag.Int(""flagname"", 1234, ""help message for flagname"") pflag.CommandLine.AddGoFlagSet(flag.CommandLine) pflag.Parse() viper.BindPFlags(pflag.CommandLine) i := viper.GetInt(""flagname"") // retrieve value from viper // ... } ``` #### Flag interfaces Viper provides two Go interfaces to bind other flag systems if you dont use `Pflags`. `FlagValue` represents a single flag. This is a very simple example on how to implement this interface: ```go type myFlag struct {} func (f myFlag) HasChanged() bool { return false } func (f myFlag) Name() string { return ""my-flag-name"" } func (f myFlag) ValueString() string { return ""my-flag-value"" } func (f myFlag) ValueType() string { return ""string"" } ``` Once your flag implements this interface, you can simply tell Viper to bind it: ```go viper.BindFlagValue(""my-flag-name"", myFlag{}) ``` `FlagValueSet` represents a group of flags. This is a very simple example on how to implement this interface: ```go type myFlagSet struct { flags []myFlag } func (f myFlagSet) VisitAll(fn func(FlagValue)) { for _, flag := range flags { fn(flag) } } ``` Once your flag set implements this interface, you can simply tell Viper to bind it: ```go fSet := myFlagSet{ flags: []myFlag{myFlag{}, myFlag{}}, } viper.BindFlagValues(""my-flags"", fSet) ``` ### Remote Key/Value Store Support To enable remote support in Viper, do a blank import of the `viper/remote` package: `import _ ""github.com/spf13/viper/remote""` Viper will read a config string (as JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL or envfile) retrieved from a path in a Key/Value store such as etcd or Consul. These values take precedence over default values, but are overridden by configuration values retrieved from disk, flags, or environment variables. Viper supports multiple hosts. To use, pass a list of endpoints separated by `;`. For example ` Viper uses [crypt]( to retrieve configuration from the K/V store, which means that you can store your configuration values encrypted and have them automatically decrypted if you have the correct gpg keyring. Encryption is optional. You can use remote configuration in conjunction with local configuration, or independently of it. `crypt` has a command-line helper that you can use to put configurations in your K/V store. `crypt` defaults to etcd on ```bash $ go get github.com/bketelsen/crypt/bin/crypt $ crypt set -plaintext /config/hugo.json /Users/hugo/settings/config.json ``` Confirm that your value was set: ```bash $ crypt get -plaintext /config/hugo.json ``` See the `crypt` documentation for examples of how to set encrypted values, or how to use Consul. ### Remote Key/Value Store Example - Unencrypted #### etcd ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""etcd"", "" viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` #### etcd3 ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""etcd3"", "" viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` #### Consul You need to set a key to Consul key/value storage with JSON value containing your desired config. For example, create a Consul key/value store key `MY_CONSUL_KEY` with value: ```json { ""port"": 8080, ""hostname"": ""myhostname.com"" } ``` ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""consul"", ""localhost:8500"", ""MY_CONSUL_KEY"") viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // Need to explicitly set this to json err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() fmt.Println(viper.Get(""port"")) // 8080 fmt.Println(viper.Get(""hostname"")) // myhostname.com ``` #### Firestore ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""firestore"", ""google-cloud-project-id"", ""collection/document"") viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // Config's format: ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` Of course, you're allowed to use `SecureRemoteProvider` also #### NATS ```go viper.AddRemoteProvider(""nats"", ""nats://127.0.0.1:4222"", ""myapp.config"") viper.SetConfigType(""json"") err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` ### Remote Key/Value Store Example - Encrypted ```go viper.AddSecureRemoteProvider(""etcd"","" viper.SetConfigType(""json"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" err := viper.ReadRemoteConfig() ``` ### Watching Changes in etcd - Unencrypted ```go // alternatively, you can create a new viper instance. var runtime_viper = viper.New() runtime_viper.AddRemoteProvider(""etcd"", "" ""/config/hugo.yml"") runtime_viper.SetConfigType(""yaml"") // because there is no file extension in a stream of bytes, supported extensions are ""json"", ""toml"", ""yaml"", ""yml"", ""properties"", ""props"", ""prop"", ""env"", ""dotenv"" // read from remote config the first time. err := runtime_viper.ReadRemoteConfig() // unmarshal config runtime_viper.Unmarshal(&runtime_conf) // open a goroutine to watch remote changes forever go func(){ for { time.Sleep(time.Second * 5) // delay after each request // currently, only tested with etcd support err := runtime_viper.WatchRemoteConfig() if err != nil { log.Errorf(""unable to read remote config: %v"", err) continue } // unmarshal new config into our runtime config struct. you can also use channel // to implement a signal to notify the system of the changes runtime_viper.Unmarshal(&runtime_conf) } }() ``` ## Getting Values From Viper In Viper, there are a few ways to get a value depending on the values type. The following functions and methods exist: * `Get(key string) : any` * `GetBool(key string) : bool` * `GetFloat64(key string) : float64` * `GetInt(key string) : int` * `GetIntSlice(key string) : []int` * `GetString(key string) : string` * `GetStringMap(key string) : map[string]any` * `GetStringMapString(key string) : map[string]string` * `GetStringSlice(key string) : []string` * `GetTime(key string) : time.Time` * `GetDuration(key string) : time.Duration` * `IsSet(key string) : bool` * `AllSettings() : map[string]any` One important thing to recognize is that each Get function will return a zero value if its not found. To check if a given key exists, the `IsSet()` method has been provided. The zero value will also be returned if the value is set, but fails to parse as the requested type. Example: ```go viper.GetString(""logfile"") // case-insensitive Setting & Getting if viper.GetBool(""verbose"") { fmt.Println(""verbose enabled"") } ``` ### Accessing nested keys The accessor methods also accept formatted paths to deeply nested keys. For example, if the following JSON file is loaded: ```json { ""host"": { ""address"": ""localhost"", ""port"": 5799 }, ""datastore"": { ""metric"": { ""host"": ""127.0.0.1"", ""port"": 3099 }, ""warehouse"": { ""host"": ""198.0.0.1"", ""port"": 2112 } } } ``` Viper can access a nested field by passing a `.` delimited path of keys: ```go GetString(""datastore.metric.host"") // (returns ""127.0.0.1"") ``` This obeys the precedence rules established above; the search for the path will cascade through the remaining configuration registries until found. For example, given this configuration file, both `datastore.metric.host` and `datastore.metric.port` are already defined (and may be overridden). If in addition `datastore.metric.protocol` was defined in the defaults, Viper would also find it. However, if `datastore.metric` was overridden (by a flag, an environment variable, the `Set()` method, ) with an immediate value, then all sub-keys of `datastore.metric` become undefined, they are shadowed by the higher-priority configuration level. Viper can access array indices by using numbers in the path. For example: ```jsonc { ""host"": { ""address"": ""localhost"", ""ports"": [ 5799, 6029 ] }, ""datastore"": { ""metric"": { ""host"": ""127.0.0.1"", ""port"": 3099 }, ""warehouse"": { ""host"": ""198.0.0.1"", ""port"": 2112 } } } GetInt(""host.ports.1"") // returns 6029 ``` Lastly, if there exists a key that matches the delimited key path, its value will be returned instead. E.g. ```jsonc { ""datastore.metric.host"": ""0.0.0.0"", ""host"": { ""address"": ""localhost"", ""port"": 5799 }, ""datastore"": { ""metric"": { ""host"": ""127.0.0.1"", ""port"": 3099 }, ""warehouse"": { ""host"": ""198.0.0.1"", ""port"": 2112 } } } GetString(""datastore.metric.host"") // returns ""0.0.0.0"" ``` ### Extracting a sub-tree When developing reusable modules, it's often useful to extract a subset of the configuration and pass it to a module. This way the module can be instantiated more than once, with different configurations. For example, an application might use multiple different cache stores for different purposes: ```yaml cache: cache1: max-items: 100 item-size: 64 cache2: max-items: 200 item-size: 80 ``` We could pass the cache name to a module (eg. `NewCache(""cache1"")`), but it would require weird concatenation for accessing config keys and would be less separated from the global config. So instead of doing that let's pass a Viper instance to the constructor that represents a subset of the configuration: ```go cache1Config := viper.Sub(""cache.cache1"") if cache1Config == nil { // Sub returns nil if the key cannot be found panic(""cache configuration not found"") } cache1 := NewCache(cache1Config) ``` **Note:** Always check the return value of `Sub`. It returns `nil` if a key cannot be found. Internally, the `NewCache` function can address `max-items` and `item-size` keys directly: ```go func NewCache(v *Viper) *Cache { return &Cache{ MaxItems: v.GetInt(""max-items""), ItemSize: v.GetInt(""item-size""), } } ``` The resulting code is easy to test, since it's decoupled from the main config structure, and easier to reuse (for the same reason). ### Unmarshaling You also have the option of Unmarshaling all or a specific value to a struct, map, etc. There are two methods to do this: * `Unmarshal(rawVal any) : error` * `UnmarshalKey(key string, rawVal any) : error` Example: ```go type config struct { Port int Name string PathMap string `mapstructure:""path_map""` } var C config err := viper.Unmarshal(&C) if err != nil { t.Fatalf(""unable to decode into struct, %v"", err) } ``` If you want to unmarshal configuration where the keys themselves contain dot (the default key delimiter), you have to change the delimiter: ```go v := viper.NewWithOptions(viper.KeyDelimiter(""::"")) v.SetDefault(""chart::values"", map[string]any{ ""ingress"": map[string]any{ ""annotations"": map[string]any{ ""traefik.frontend.rule.type"": ""PathPrefix"", ""traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect"": ""true"", }, }, }) type config struct { Chart struct{ Values map[string]any } } var C config v.Unmarshal(&C) ``` Viper also supports unmarshaling into embedded structs: ```go /* Example config: module: enabled: true token: 89h3f98hbwf987h3f98wenf89ehf */ type config struct { Module struct { Enabled bool moduleConfig `mapstructure:"",squash""` } } // moduleConfig could be in a module specific package type moduleConfig struct { Token string } var C config err := viper.Unmarshal(&C) if err != nil { t.Fatalf(""unable to decode into struct, %v"", err) } ``` Viper uses [github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure]( under the hood for unmarshaling values which uses `mapstructure` tags by default. ### Decoding custom formats A frequently requested feature for Viper is adding more value formats and decoders. For example, parsing character (dot, comma, semicolon, etc) separated strings into slices. This is already available in Viper using mapstructure decode hooks. Read more about the details in [this blog post]( ### Marshalling to string You may need to marshal all the settings held in viper into a string rather than write them to a file. You can use your favorite format's marshaller with the config returned by `AllSettings()`. ```go import ( yaml ""gopkg.in/yaml.v2"" // ... ) func yamlStringSettings() string { c := viper.AllSettings() bs, err := yaml.Marshal(c) if err != nil { log.Fatalf(""unable to marshal config to YAML: %v"", err) } return string(bs) } ``` ## Viper or Vipers? Viper comes ready to use out of the box. There is no configuration or initialization needed to begin using Viper. Since most applications will want to use a single central repository for their configuration, the viper package provides this. It is similar to a singleton. In all of the examples above, they demonstrate using viper in its singleton style approach. ### Working with multiple vipers You can also create many different vipers for use in your application. Each will have its own unique set of configurations and values. Each can read from a different config file, key value store, etc. All of the functions that viper package supports are mirrored as methods on a viper. Example: ```go x := viper.New() y := viper.New() x.SetDefault(""ContentDir"", ""content"") y.SetDefault(""ContentDir"", ""foobar"") //... ``` When working with multiple vipers, it is up to the user to keep track of the different vipers. ## Q & A ### Why is it called Viper? A: Viper is designed to be a [companion]( to [Cobra]( While both can operate completely independently, together they make a powerful pair to handle much of your application foundation needs. ### Why is it called Cobra? Is there a better name for a [commander]( ### Does Viper support case sensitive keys? **tl;dr:** No. Viper merges configuration from various sources, many of which are either case insensitive or uses different casing than the rest of the sources (eg. env vars). In order to provide the best experience when using multiple sources, the decision has been made to make all keys case insensitive. There has been several attempts to implement case sensitivity, but unfortunately it's not that trivial. We might take a stab at implementing it in [Viper v2]( but despite the initial noise, it does not seem to be requested that much. You can vote for case sensitivity by filling out this feedback form: ### Is it safe to concurrently read and write to a viper? No, you will need to synchronize access to the viper yourself (for example by using the `sync` package). Concurrent reads and writes can cause a panic. ## Troubleshooting See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). ## Development **For an optimal developer experience, it is recommended to install [Nix]( and [direnv]( _Alternatively, install [Go]( on your computer then run `make deps` to install the rest of the dependencies._ Run the test suite: ```shell make test ``` Run linters: ```shell make lint # pass -j option to run them in parallel ``` Some linter violations can automatically be fixed: ```shell make fmt ``` ## License The project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).","2k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, kind/enhancement, kind/bug, area/dependencies, kind/support, kind/question, release-note/new-feature, resolution/wontfix, resolution/invalid, resolution/duplicate, release-note/misc, release-note/ignore, release-note/enhancement, release-note/deprecation, release-note/dependency-update, release-note/bug-fix, release-note/breaking-change, help wanted, good first issue, area/documentation"

K9s provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage your applications in the wild. K9s continually watches Kubernetes for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources. --- ## Note... K9s is not pimped out by a big corporation with deep pockets. It is a complex OSS project that demands a lot of my time to maintain and support. K9s will always remain OSS and therefore free! That said, if you feel k9s makes your day to day Kubernetes journey a tad brighter, saves you time and makes you more productive, please consider [sponsoring us!]( Your donations will go a long way in keeping our servers lights on and beers in our fridge! **Thank you!** --- []( []( []( []( []( []( []( []( --- ## Screenshots 1.

In order to build K9s from source you must: 1. Clone the repo 2. Build and run the executable ```shell make build && ./execs/k9s ``` --- ## Running with Docker ### Running the official Docker image You can run k9s as a Docker container by mounting your `KUBECONFIG`: ```shell docker run --rm -it -v $KUBECONFIG:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s ``` For default path it would be: ```shell docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s ``` ### Building your own Docker image You can build your own Docker image of k9s from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with the following: ```shell docker build -t k9s-docker:v0.0.1 . ``` You can get the latest stable `kubectl` version and pass it to the `docker build` command with the `--build-arg` option. You can use the `--build-arg` option to pass any valid `kubectl` version (like `v1.18.0` or `v1.19.1`). ```shell KUBECTL_VERSION=$(make kubectl-stable-version 2>/dev/null) docker build --build-arg KUBECTL_VERSION=${KUBECTL_VERSION} -t k9s-docker:0.1 . ``` Run your container: ```shell docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config k9s-docker:0.1 ``` --- ## PreFlight Checks * K9s uses 256 colors terminal mode. On `Nix system make sure TERM is set accordingly. ```shell export TERM=xterm-256color ``` * In order to issue resource edit commands make sure your EDITOR and KUBE_EDITOR env vars are set. ```shell # Kubectl edit command will use this env var. export KUBE_EDITOR=my_fav_editor ``` * K9s prefers recent kubernetes versions ie 1.28+ --- ## K8S Compatibility Matrix | k9s | k8s client | | ------------------ | ---------- | | >= v0.27.0 | 1.26.1 | | v0.26.7 - v0.26.6 | 1.25.3 | | v0.26.5 - v0.26.4 | 1.25.1 | | v0.26.3 - v0.26.1 | 1.24.3 | | v0.26.0 - v0.25.19 | 1.24.2 | | v0.25.18 - v0.25.3 | 1.22.3 | | v0.25.2 - v0.25.0 | 1.22.0 | | <= v0.24 | 1.21.3 | --- ## The Command Line ```shell # List current version k9s version # To get info about K9s runtime (logs, configs, etc..) k9s info # List all available CLI options k9s help # To run K9s in a given namespace k9s -n mycoolns # Start K9s in an existing KubeConfig context k9s --context coolCtx # Start K9s in readonly mode - with all cluster modification commands disabled k9s --readonly ``` ## Logs And Debug Logs Given the nature of the ui k9s does produce logs to a specific location.

K9s leverages [XDG]( to load its various configurations files. For information on the default locations for your OS please see [this link]( If you are still confused a quick `k9s info` will reveal where k9s is loading its configurations from. Alternatively, you can set `K9S_CONFIG_DIR` to tell K9s the directory location to pull its configurations from. | Unix | macOS | Windows | |-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------| | `~/.config/k9s` | `~/Library/Application Support/k9s` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\k9s` | > NOTE: This is still in flux and will change while in pre-release stage! ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml k9s: # Enable periodic refresh of resource browser windows.

Popeye itself uses a configuration called `spinach.yml`, but when integrating with K9s the cluster-specific file should be name `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/share/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/spinach.yml`. This allows you to have a different spinach config per cluster. --- ## Node Shell By enabling the nodeShell feature gate on a given cluster, K9s allows you to shell into your cluster nodes. Once enabled, you will have a new `s` for `shell` menu option while in node view. K9s will launch a pod on the selected node using a special k9s_shell pod. Furthermore, you can refine your shell pod by using a custom docker image preloaded with the shell tools you love. By default k9s uses a BusyBox image, but you can configure it as follows: ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml k9s: # You can also further tune the shell pod specification shellPod: image: cool_kid_admin:42 namespace: blee limits: cpu: 100m memory: 100Mi ``` Then in your cluster configuration file... ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/cluster-1/context-1 k9s: cluster: cluster-1 readOnly: false namespace: active: default lockFavorites: false favorites: - kube-system - default view: active: po featureGates: nodeShell: true # => Enable this feature gate to make nodeShell available on this cluster portForwardAddress: localhost ``` --- ## Command Aliases In K9s, you can define your very own command aliases (shortnames) to access your resources. In your `$HOME/.config/k9s` define a file called `aliases.yaml`. A K9s alias defines pairs of alias:gvr. A gvr (Group/Version/Resource) represents a fully qualified Kubernetes resource identifier. Here is an example of an alias file: ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/aliases.yaml aliases: pp: v1/pods crb: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterrolebindings # As of v0.30.0 you can also refer to another command alias... fred: pod fred app=blee # => view pods in namespace fred with labels matching app=blee ``` Using this aliases file, you can now type `:pp` or `:crb` or `:fred` to activate their respective commands. --- ## HotKey Support Entering the command mode and typing a resource name or alias, could be cumbersome for navigating thru often used resources. We're introducing hotkeys that allow users to define their own key combination to activate their favorite resource views. Additionally, you can define context specific hotkeys by add a context level configuration file in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/hotkeys.yaml` In order to surface hotkeys globally please follow these steps: 1. Create a file named `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/hotkeys.yaml` 2. Add the following to your `hotkeys.yaml`. You can use resource name/short name to specify a command ie same as typing it while in command mode. ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/hotkeys.yaml hotKeys: # Hitting Shift-0 navigates to your pod view shift-0: shortCut: Shift-0 description: Viewing pods command: pods # Hitting Shift-1 navigates to your deployments shift-1: shortCut: Shift-1 description: View deployments command: dp # Hitting Shift-2 navigates to your xray deployments shift-2: shortCut: Shift-2 description: Xray Deployments command: xray deploy # Hitting Shift-S view the resources in the namespace of your current selection shift-s: shortCut: Shift-S override: true # => will override the default shortcut related action if set to true (default to false) description: Namespaced resources command: ""$RESOURCE_NAME $NAMESPACE"" keepHistory: true # whether you can return to the previous view ``` Not feeling so hot? Your custom hotkeys will be listed in the help view `?`. Also your hotkeys file will be automatically reloaded so you can readily use your hotkeys as you define them. You can choose any keyboard shortcuts that make sense to you, provided they are not part of the standard K9s shortcuts list. Similarly, referencing environment variables in hotkeys is also supported. The available environment variables can refer to the description in the [Plugins](#plugins) section. > NOTE: This feature/configuration might change in future releases! --- ## FastForwards As of v0.25.0, you can leverage the `FastForwards` feature to tell K9s how to default port-forwards. In situations where you are dealing with multiple containers or containers exposing multiple ports, it can be cumbersome to specify the desired port-forward from the dialog as in most cases, you already know which container/port tuple you desire. For these use cases, you can now annotate your manifests with the following annotations: @ `k9scli.io/auto-port-forwards` activates one or more port-forwards directly bypassing the port-forward dialog all together. @ `k9scli.io/port-forwards` pre-selects one or more port-forwards when launching the port-forward dialog. The annotation value takes on the shape `container-name::[local-port:]container-port` > NOTE: for either cases above you can specify the container port by name or number in your annotation! ### Example ```yaml # Pod fred apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: fred annotations: k9scli.io/auto-port-forwards: zorg::5556 # => will default to container zorg port 5556 and local port 5566. No port-forward dialog will be shown. # Or... k9scli.io/port-forwards: bozo::9090:p1 # => launches the port-forward dialog selecting default port-forward on container bozo port named p1(8081) # mapping to local port 9090. ... spec: containers: - name: zorg ports: - name: p1 containerPort: 5556 ... - name: bozo ports: - name: p1 containerPort: 8081 - name: p2 containerPort: 5555 ... ``` The annotation value must specify a container to forward to as well as a local port and container port. The container port may be specified as either a port number or port name. If the local port is omitted then the local port will default to the container port number. Here are a few examples: 1. bozo::http - creates a pf on container `bozo` with port name If http specifies port number 8080 then the local port will be 8080 as well. 2. bozo::9090:http - creates a pf on container `bozo` mapping local port 9090-> 3. bozo::9090:8080 - creates a pf on container `bozo` mapping local port 9090->8080 --- ## Resource Custom Columns [SneakCast v0.17.0 on The Beach! - Yup! sound is sucking but what a setting!]( You can change which columns shows up for a given resource via custom views. To surface this feature, you will need to create a new configuration file, namely `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/views.yaml`. This file leverages GVR (Group/Version/Resource) to configure the associated table view columns. If no GVR is found for a view the default rendering will take over (ie what we have now). Going wide will add all the remaining columns that are available on the given resource after your custom columns. To boot, you can edit your views config file and tune your resources views live! > NOTE: This is experimental and will most likely change as we iron this out! Here is a sample views configuration that customize a pods and services views. ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/views.yaml views: v1/pods: columns: - AGE - NAMESPACE - NAME - IP - NODE - STATUS - READY v1/services: columns: - AGE - NAMESPACE - NAME - TYPE - CLUSTER-IP ``` --- ## Plugins K9s allows you to extend your command line and tooling by defining your very own cluster commands via plugins. K9s will look at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/plugins.yaml` to locate all available plugins. A plugin is defined as follows: * Shortcut option represents the key combination a user would type to activate the plugin * Override option make that the default action related to the shortcut will be overrided by the plugin * Confirm option (when enabled) lets you see the command that is going to be executed and gives you an option to confirm or prevent execution * Description will be printed next to the shortcut in the k9s menu * Scopes defines a collection of resources names/short-names for the views associated with the plugin. You can specify `all` to provide this shortcut for all views. * Command represents ad-hoc commands the plugin runs upon activation * Background specifies whether or not the command runs in the background * Args specifies the various arguments that should apply to the command above * OverwriteOutput options allows plugin developers to provide custom messages on plugin execution K9s does provide additional environment variables for you to customize your plugins arguments. Currently, the available environment variables are as follows: * `$RESOURCE_GROUP` -- the selected resource group * `$RESOURCE_VERSION` -- the selected resource api version * `$RESOURCE_NAME` -- the selected resource name * `$NAMESPACE` -- the selected resource namespace * `$NAME` -- the selected resource name * `$CONTAINER` -- the current container if applicable * `$FILTER` -- the current filter if any * `$KUBECONFIG` -- the KubeConfig location. * `$CLUSTER` the active cluster name * `$CONTEXT` the active context name * `$USER` the active user * `$GROUPS` the active groups * `$POD` while in a container view * `$COL-` use a given column name for a viewed resource. Must be prefixed by `COL-`! Curly braces can be used to embed an environment variable inside another string, or if the column name contains special characters. (e.g. `${NAME}-example` or `${COL-%CPU/L}`) ### Plugin Example This defines a plugin for viewing logs on a selected pod using `ctrl-l` as shortcut. ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/plugins.yaml plugins: # Defines a plugin to provide a `ctrl-l` shortcut to tail the logs while in pod view. fred: shortCut: Ctrl-L override: false confirm: false description: Pod logs scopes: - pods command: kubectl background: false args: - logs - -f - $NAME - -n - $NAMESPACE - --context - $CONTEXT ``` > NOTE: This is an experimental feature! Options and layout may change in future K9s releases as this feature solidifies. --- ## Benchmark Your Applications K9s integrates [Hey]( from the brilliant and super talented [Jaana Dogan]( `Hey` is a CLI tool to benchmark HTTP endpoints similar to AB bench. This preliminary feature currently supports benchmarking port-forwards and services (Read the paint on this is way fresh!). To setup a port-forward, you will need to navigate to the PodView, select a pod and a container that exposes a given port. Using `SHIFT-F` a dialog comes up to allow you to specify a local port to forward. Once acknowledged, you can navigate to the PortForward view (alias `pf`) listing out your active port-forwards. Selecting a port-forward and using `CTRL-B` will run a benchmark on that HTTP endpoint. To view the results of your benchmark runs, go to the Benchmarks view (alias `be`). You should now be able to select a benchmark and view the run stats details by pressing ``. NOTE: Port-forwards only last for the duration of the K9s session and will be terminated upon exit. Initially, the benchmarks will run with the following defaults: * Concurrency Level: 1 * Number of Requests: 200 * HTTP Verb: GET * Path: / The PortForward view is backed by a new K9s config file namely: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/benchmarks.yaml`. Each cluster you connect to will have its own bench config file, containing the name of the K8s context for the cluster. Changes to this file should automatically update the PortForward view to indicate how you want to run your benchmarks. Benchmarks result reports are stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY` Here is a sample benchmarks.yaml configuration. Please keep in mind this file will likely change in subsequent releases! ```yaml # This file resides in $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/benchmarks.yaml benchmarks: # Indicates the default concurrency and number of requests setting if a container or service rule does not match. defaults: # One concurrent connection concurrency: 1 # Number of requests that will be sent to an endpoint requests: 500 containers: # Containers section allows you to configure your http container's endpoints and benchmarking settings. # NOTE: the container ID syntax uses namespace/pod-name:container-name default/nginx:nginx: # Benchmark a container named nginx using POST HTTP verb using URL and headers. concurrency: 1 requests: 10000 path: /bozo method: POST body: {""fred"":""blee""} header: Accept: - text/html Content-Type: - application/json services: # Similarly you can Benchmark an HTTP service exposed either via NodePort, LoadBalancer types. # Service ID is ns/svc-name default/nginx: # Set the concurrency level concurrency: 5 # Number of requests to be sent requests: 500 method: GET # This setting will depend on whether service is NodePort or LoadBalancer. NodePort may require vendor port tunneling setting. # Set this to a node if NodePort or LB if applicable. IP or dns name. host: A.B.C.D path: /bumblebeetuna auth: user: jean-baptiste-emmanuel password: Zorg! ``` --- ## K9s RBAC FU On RBAC enabled clusters, you would need to give your users/groups capabilities so that they can use K9s to explore their Kubernetes cluster. K9s needs minimally read privileges at both the cluster and namespace level to display resources and metrics. These rules below are just suggestions. You will need to customize them based on your environment policies. If you need to edit/delete resources extra Fu will be necessary. > NOTE! Cluster/Namespace access may change in the future as K9s evolves. > NOTE! We expect K9s to keep running even in atrophied clusters/namespaces. Please file issues if this is not the case! ### Cluster RBAC scope ```yaml --- # K9s Reader ClusterRole kind: ClusterRole apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: k9s rules: # Grants RO access to cluster resources node and namespace - apiGroups: [""""] resources: [""nodes"", ""namespaces""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to RBAC resources - apiGroups: [""rbac.authorization.k8s.io""] resources: [""clusterroles"", ""roles"", ""clusterrolebindings"", ""rolebindings""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to CRD resources - apiGroups: [""apiextensions.k8s.io""] resources: [""customresourcedefinitions""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to metric server (if present) - apiGroups: [""metrics.k8s.io""] resources: [""nodes"", ""pods""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] --- # Sample K9s user ClusterRoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: k9s subjects: - kind: User name: fernand apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: k9s apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io ``` ### Namespace RBAC scope If your users are constrained to certain namespaces, K9s will need to following role to enable read access to namespaced resources. ```yaml --- # K9s Reader Role (default namespace) kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: k9s namespace: default rules: # Grants RO access to most namespaced resources - apiGroups: ["""", ""apps"", ""autoscaling"", ""batch"", ""extensions""] resources: [""*""] verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""watch""] # Grants RO access to metric server - apiGroups: [""metrics.k8s.io""] resources: [""pods"", ""nodes""] verbs: - get - list - watch --- # Sample K9s user RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: RoleBinding metadata: name: k9s namespace: default subjects: - kind: User name: fernand apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: Role name: k9s apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io ``` --- ## Skins Example: Dracula Skin ;) You can style K9s based on your own sense of look and style. Skins are YAML files, that enable a user to change the K9s presentation layer. See this repo `skins` directory for examples. You can skin k9s by default by specifying a UI.skin attribute. You can also change K9s skins based on the context you are connecting too. In this case, you can specify a skin field on your cluster config aka `skin: dracula` (just the name of the skin file without the extension!) and copy this repo `skins/dracula.yaml` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/skins/` directory. In the case where your cluster spans several contexts, you can add a skin context configuration to your context configuration. This is a collection of {context_name, skin} tuples (please see example below!) Colors can be defined by name or using a hex representation. Of recent, we've added a color named `default` to indicate a transparent background color to preserve your terminal background color settings if so desired. > NOTE: This is very much an experimental feature at this time, more will be added/modified if this feature has legs so thread accordingly! > NOTE: Please see [K9s Skins]( for a list of available colors. To skin a specific context and provided the file `in_the_navy.yaml` is present in your skins directory. ```yaml # $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/config.yaml k9s: cluster: clusterX skin: in_the_navy readOnly: false namespace: active: default lockFavorites: false favorites: - kube-system - default view: active: po featureGates: nodeShell: false portForwardAddress: localhost ``` You can also specify a default skin for all contexts in the root k9s config file as so: ```yaml # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml k9s: liveViewAutoRefresh: false screenDumpDir: /tmp/dumps refreshRate: 2 maxConnRetry: 5 readOnly: false noExitOnCtrlC: false ui: enableMouse: false headless: false logoless: false crumbsless: false noIcons: false # Toggles reactive UI.

cosmopolitan,jart/cosmopolitan,15411,"['C', 'POV-Ray SDL', 'Assembly']","['polyglot', 'containers', 'linux', 'openbsd', 'netbsd']","[]( # Cosmopolitan [Cosmopolitan Libc]( makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, like Java, except it doesn't need an interpreter or virtual machine. Instead, it reconfigures stock GCC and Clang to output a POSIX-approved polyglot format that runs natively on Linux + Mac + Windows + FreeBSD + OpenBSD + NetBSD + BIOS with the best possible performance and the tiniest footprint imaginable. ## Background For an introduction to this project, please read the [actually portable executable]( blog post and [cosmopolitan libc]( website. We also have [API documentation]( ## Getting Started You can start by obtaining a release of our `cosmocc` compiler from . ```sh mkdir -p cosmocc cd cosmocc wget unzip cosmocc.zip ``` Here's an example program we can write: ```c // hello.c #include int main() { printf(""hello world\n""); } ``` It can be compiled as follows: ```sh cosmocc -o hello hello.c ./hello ``` The Cosmopolitan Libc runtime links some heavyweight troubleshooting features by default, which are very useful for developers and admins. Here's how you can log system calls: ```sh ./hello --strace ``` Here's how you can get a much more verbose log of function calls: ```sh ./hello --ftrace ``` You can use the Cosmopolitan's toolchain to build conventional open source projects which use autotools. This strategy normally works: ```sh export CC=x86_64-unknown-cosmo-cc export CXX=x86_64-unknown-cosmo-c++ ./configure --prefix=/opt/cosmos/x86_64 make -j make install ``` ## Cosmopolitan Source Builds Cosmopolitan can be compiled from source on any of our supported platforms. The Makefile will download cosmocc automatically. It's recommended that you install a systemwide APE Loader. This command requires `sudo` access to copy the `ape` command to a system folder and register with binfmt_misc on Linux, for even more performance. ```sh ape/apeinstall.sh ``` You can now build the mono repo with any modern version of GNU Make. To make life easier, we've included one in the cosmocc toolchain, which is guaranteed to be compatible and furthermore includes our extensions for doing build system sandboxing. ```sh build/bootstrap/make -j8 o//examples/hello ``` Since the Cosmopolitan repository is very large, you might only want to build one particular thing. Here's an example of a target that can be compiled relatively quickly, which is a simple POSIX test that only depends on core LIBC packages. ```sh rm -rf o//libc o//test build/bootstrap/make o//test/posix/signal_test o//test/posix/signal_test ``` Sometimes it's desirable to build a subset of targets, without having to list out each individual one. For example if you wanted to build and run all the unit tests in the `TEST_POSIX` package, you could say: ```sh build/bootstrap/make o//test/posix ``` Cosmopolitan provides a variety of build modes. For example, if you want really tiny binaries (as small as 12kb in size) then you'd say: ```sh build/bootstrap/make m=tiny ``` You can furthermore cut out the bloat of other operating systems, and have Cosmopolitan become much more similar to Musl Libc. ```sh build/bootstrap/make m=tinylinux ``` For further details, see [//build/config.mk](build/config.mk). ## Debugging To print a log of system calls to stderr: ```sh cosmocc -o hello hello.c ./hello --strace ``` To print a log of function calls to stderr: ```sh cosmocc -o hello hello.c ./hello --ftrace ``` Both strace and ftrace use the unbreakable kprintf() facility, which is able to be sent to a file by setting an environment variable. ```sh export KPRINTF_LOG=log ./hello --strace ``` ## GDB Here's the recommended `~/.gdbinit` config: ```gdb set host-charset UTF-8 set target-charset UTF-8 set target-wide-charset UTF-8 set osabi none set complaints 0 set confirm off set history save on set history filename ~/.gdb_history define asm layout asm layout reg end define src layout src layout reg end src ``` You normally run the `.dbg` file under gdb. If you need to debug the `` file itself, then you can load the debug symbols independently as ```sh gdb foo -ex 'add-symbol-file foo.dbg 0x401000' ``` ## Platform Notes ### Shells If you use zsh and have trouble running APE programs try `sh -c ./prog` or simply upgrade to zsh 5.9+ (since we patched it two years ago). The same is the case for Python `subprocess`, old versions of fish, etc. ### Linux Some Linux systems are configured to launch MZ executables under WINE. Other distros configure their stock installs so that APE programs will print ""run-detectors: unable to find an interpreter"". For example: ```sh jart@ubuntu:~$ wget jart@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x dash jart@ubuntu:~$ ./dash run-detectors: unable to find an interpreter for ./dash ``` You can fix that by registering APE with `binfmt_misc`: ```sh sudo wget -O /usr/bin/ape -m).elf sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/ape sudo sh -c ""echo ':APE:M::MZqFpD::/usr/bin/ape:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register"" sudo sh -c ""echo ':APE-jart:M::jartsr::/usr/bin/ape:' >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register"" ``` You should be good now. APE will not only work, it'll launch executables 400s faster now too. However if things still didn't work out, it's also possible to disable `binfmt_misc` as follows: ```sh sudo sh -c 'echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/cli' # remove Ubuntu's MZ interpreter sudo sh -c 'echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status' # remove ALL binfmt_misc entries ``` ### WSL It's normally unsafe to use APE in a WSL environment, because it tries to run MZ executables as WIN32 binaries within the WSL environment. In order to make it safe to use Cosmopolitan software on WSL, run this: ```sh sudo sh -c ""echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop"" ``` ## Discord Chatroom The Cosmopolitan development team collaborates on the Redbean Discord server.

Mailspring,Foundry376/Mailspring,15165,"['C', 'TypeScript', 'JavaScript']","['email', 'mail', 'electron', 'osx', 'windows']","# Mailspring []( []( **Mailspring is a new version of Nylas Mail maintained by one of the original authors. It's faster, leaner, and shipping today!** It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2]( It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero ""CPU Wakes"", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features. Mailspring's UI is open source (GPLv3) and written in TypeScript with [Electron]( and [React]( - it's built on a plugin architecture and was designed to be easy to extend. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md]( to get started! Mailspring's sync engine is spawned by the Electron application and runs locally on your computer. [It is open source (GPLv3) and written in C++ and C.]( For convenience, however, when you set up your development environment, Mailspring uses the latest version of the sync engine we've shipped for your platform so you don't need to pull sources or install its compile-time dependencies. ## Features Mailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send Later, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock with a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton of email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company profiles. **All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send your email credentials to the cloud.** For a full list of features, check out [getmailspring.com]( ## Download Mailspring You can download compiled versions of Mailspring for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (deb, rpm and snap) from [ ## Getting Help You can find community-based help and discussion with other Mailspring users on our [Discourse community]( ## Contributing Mailspring is entirely open-source. Pull requests and contributions are welcome! There are three ways to contribute: building a plugin, building a theme, and submitting pull requests to the project itself. When you're getting started, you may want to join our [Discourse]( so you can ask questions and learn from other people doing development. [](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ### Running Mailspring from Source To install all dependencies and run Mailspring from its source code, run the following commands from the root directory of the Mailspring repository: ``` export npm_config_arch=x64 # If you are on an M1 / Apple Silicon Mac npm install npm start ``` You can attach command line parameters by separating them using a double hyphen: ``` npm start -- --help ``` ### Building Mailspring To build Mailspring, you need to run the following command from the root directory of the Mailspring repository: ``` npm run-script build ``` ### Building A Plugin Plugins lie at the heart of Mailspring and give it its powerful features. Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools, experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started guide]( to write your first plugin in five minutes. - To create your own theme, check out the [Mailspring-Theme-Starter]( - To create your own plugin, check out the [Mailspring-Plugin-Starter]( A plugin ""store"" like the Chrome Web Store is coming soon, and will make it easy for other users to discover plugins you create. (Right now, users need to ""sideload"" the plugins into the app by downloading them and copying them into place.) You can share and browse Mailspring Plugins, and discuss plugin development with other developers, on our [Discourse]( ### Building a Theme The Mailspring user interface is styled using CSS, which means it's easy to modify and extend. Mailspring comes stock with a few beautiful themes, and there are many more which have been built by community developers. To start creating a theme, [clone the theme starter]( If you are updating an existing Nylas theme for Mailspring here is a [step by step tutorial]( Notice: as part of the update process you will probably need to [import mailspring base variables]( You can share and browse Mailspring Themes, and discuss theme development with other developers, on our [Discourse]( ### Localizing / Translating Mailspring (1.5.0 and above) supports localization. If you're a fluent speaker of another language, we'd love your help improving translations. Check out the [LOCALIZATION]( guide for more information.

blurhash,woltapp/blurhash,15125,"['C', 'Swift', 'SCSS']",[],"# [BlurHash]( BlurHash is a compact representation of a placeholder for an image. ## Why would you want this? Does your designer cry every time you load their beautifully designed screen, and it is full of empty boxes because all the images have not loaded yet? Does your database engineer cry when you want to solve this by trying to cram little thumbnail images into your data to show as placeholders? BlurHash will solve your problems! How? Like this: You can also see nice examples and try it out yourself at [blurha.sh]( ## How does it work? In short, BlurHash takes an image, and gives you a short string (only 20-30 characters!) that represents the placeholder for this image. You do this on the backend of your service, and store the string along with the image. When you send data to your client, you send both the URL to the image, and the BlurHash string. Your client then takes the string, and decodes it into an image that it shows while the real image is loading over the network. The string is short enough that it comfortably fits into whatever data format you use. For instance, it can easily be added as a field in a JSON object. In summary: Want to know all the gory technical details? Read the [algorithm description](Algorithm.md). Implementing the algorithm is actually quite easy! Implementations are short and easily ported to your favourite language or platform. ## Implementations So far, we have created these implementations: * [C](C) - An encoder implementation in portable C code. * [Swift](Swift) - Encoder and decoder implementations, and a larger library offering advanced features. There is also an example app to play around with the algorithm. * [Kotlin](Kotlin) - A decoder implementation for Android. * [TypeScript](TypeScript) - Encoder and decoder implementations, and an example page to test. * [Python]( - Integration of the C encoder code into Python. These cover our use cases, but could probably use polishing, extending and improving. There are also these third party implementations that we know of: * [Pure Python]( - Implementation of both the encoder and decoder in pure Python. * [One version in Go]( and [another version in Go]( * [PHP]( - Encoder and decoder implementations in pure PHP. * [Java]( - Encoder implementation in Java. * [Clojure]( - Encoder and decoder implementations in Clojure. * [Nim]( - Encoder and decoder implementation in pure Nim. * [Rust and WebAssembly]( - Encoder and decoder implementations in Rust. Distributed as both native Rust and WebAssembly packages. * [Ruby]( - Encoder implementation in Ruby. * [Crystal]( - Encoder implementation in pure Crystal. * [Elm]( - Encoder and decoder in Elm. * [Dart]( - Encoder and decoder implementation in C into Dart using dart-ffi. * [Pure Dart]( - Encoder and decoder implementation in pure Dart. * [.NET]( - Encoder and decoder in C#. * [JavaScript]( - Encoder and decoder implementation in pure JavaScript. * [.NET]( - Encoder implementation in C#. * [Haskell]( - Encoder and decoder in pure Haskell. * [Scala]( - Encoder and decoder in Scala. * [Elixir]( - Encoder implementation in pure Elixir. * [ReScript]( - Encoder and decoder implementation in ReScript (BuckleScript). * [JavaScript]( - Tiny optimized decoder implementation JS. * [Xojo]( - Encoder and decoder implementation in pure Xojo. * [React Native]( - UI Component for React Native. (Decoder in Swift and Kotlin) * [Zig]( - Encoder implementation in Zig. * [Titanium SDK]( - Decoder for Titanium SDK (Android) * [BQN]( - Encoder, decoder and terminal viewer in pure BQN. * [Jetpack Compose]( - Decoder Jetpack Compose implementation * [C++]( - Encoder and decoder in C++. * [Kotlin Multiplatform]( - Encoding & decoding for Android, iOS & JVM * [OCaml]( - Encoder implementation in OCaml. Can't find the language you're looking for? Try your luck with the GitHub search. For example, here are the search results for [repos which have ""blurhash"" in their name]( Perhaps you'd like to help extend this list? Which brings us to... ## Contributing We'd love contributions! The algorithm is [very simple](Algorithm.md) - less than two hundred lines of code - and can easily be ported to your platform of choice. And having support for more platforms would be wonderful! So, Java decoder? Golang encoder? Haskell? Rust? We want them all! We will also try to tag any issues on our [issue tracker]( that we'd love help with, so if you just want to dip in, go have a look. You can file a pull request with us, or you can start your own repo and project if you want to run everything yourself, we don't mind. If you do want to contribute to this project, we have a [code of conduct](CodeOfConduct.md). ## Users Who uses BlurHash? Here are some projects we know about: * [Wolt]( - We are of course using it ourselves. BlurHashes are used in the mobile clients on iOS and Android, as well as on the web, as placeholders during image loading. * [Mastodon]( - The Mastodon decentralised social media network uses BlurHashes both as loading placeholders, as well as for hiding media marked as sensitive. * [Signal]( - Signal Private Messenger uses Blurhashes as placeholders before photo & video messages are downloaded in chat conversations. * [Jellyfin]( - Jellyfin the free software media system uses Blurhashes as placeholders for images of movies and TV shows when they are being downloaded. ## Good Questions ### How fast is encoding? Decoding? These implementations are not very optimised. Running them on very large images can be a bit slow. The performance of the encoder and decoder are about the same for the same input or output size, so decoding very large placeholders, especially on your UI thread, can also be a bit slow. However! The trick to using the algorithm efficiently is to not run it on full-sized data. The fine detail of an image is all thrown away, so you should scale your images down before running BlurHash on them. If you are creating thumbnails, run BlurHash on those instead of the full images. Similarly, when displaying the placeholders, very small images work very well when scaled up. We usually decode placeholders that are 32 or even 20 pixels wide, and then let the UI layer scale them up, which is indistinguishable from decoding them at full size. ### How do I pick the number of X and Y components? It depends a bit on taste. The more components you pick, the more information is retained in the placeholder, but the longer the BlurHash string will be. Also, it doesn't always look good with too many components. We usually go with 4 by 3, which seems to strike a nice balance. However, you should adjust the number of components depending on the aspect ratio of your images. For instance, very wide images should have more X components and fewer Y components. The Swift example project contains a test app where you can play around with the parameters and see the results. ### What is the `punch` parameter in some of these implementations? It is a parameter that adjusts the contrast on the decoded image. 1 means normal, smaller values will make the effect more subtle, and larger values will make it stronger. This is basically a design parameter, which lets you adjust the look. Technically, what it does is scale the AC components up or down. ### Is this only useful as an image loading placeholder? Well, that is what it was designed for originally, but it turns out to be useful for a few other things: * Masking images without having to use expensive blurs - [Mastodon]( uses it for this. * The data representation makes it quite easy to extract colour averages of the image for different areas. You can easily find approximations of things like the average colour of the top edge of the image, or of a corner. There is some code in the Swift BlurHashKit implementation to experiment with this. Also, the average colour of the entire image is just the DC component and can be decoded even without implementing any of the more complicated DCT stuff. * We have been meaning to try to implement tinted drop shadows for UI elements by using the BlurHash and extending the borders. Haven't actually had time to implement this yet though. ### Why base 83? First, 83 seems to be about how many low-ASCII characters you can find that are safe for use in all of JSON, HTML and shells. Secondly, 83 * 83 is very close to, and a little more than, 19 * 19 * 19, making it ideal for encoding three AC components in two characters. ### What about using the full Unicode character set to get a more efficient encoding? We haven't looked into how much overhead UTF-8 encoding would introduce versus base 83 in single-byte characters, but the encoding and decoding would probably be a lot more complicated, so in the spirit of minimalism BlurHash uses the simpler option. It might also be awkward to copy-paste, depending on OS capabilities. If you think it can be done and is worth it, though, do make your own version and show us! We'd love to see it in action. ### What about other basis representations than DCT? This is something we'd *love* to try. The DCT looks quite ugly when you increase the number of components, probably because the shape of the basis functions becomes too visible. Using a different basis with more aesthetically pleasing shape might be a big win. However, we have not managed come up with one. Some experimenting with a [Fourier-Bessel base]( targeted at images that are going to be cropped into circles has been done, but without much success. Here again we'd love to see what you can come up with! ## Authors * [Dag gren]( - Original algorithm design, Swift and C implementations * [Mykhailo Shchurov]( - Kotlin decoder implementation * [Hang Duy Khiem]( - Android demo app * [Olli Mahlamki]( - TypeScript decoder and encoder implementations * [Atte Lautanala]( - Python integration * [Lorenz Diener]( - Pure Python implementation * [Boris Momilovi]( - Pure PHP implementation * [Hendrik Schnepel]( - Java encoder implementation * [Tuomo Virolainen]( - Clojure implementation * [Fotis Papadogeorgopoulos]( - Rust and WebAssembly implementation * [Sam Protas]( - Pure Haskell implementation * [Markus Sammallahti]( - Scala implementation * [Kacper Perzankowski]( - Elixir encoder implementation * [Belvi Nosakhare]( - Kotlin extensions of Blurhash for ImageView, Glide, and Piccasso optimized for Android. * [Armedi]( - ReScript (BuckleScript) implementation. * [Ricardo Cruz]( - Xojo implementation. * [Marc Rousavy]( - React Native UI Component * [Matt Howard]( - Zig implementation * [Hannu Hartikainen]( - BQN implementation * [Wajahat Iqbal]( - Jetpack compose-based implementation optimized for using any component as a painter. * _Your name here?_","335, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Security, Insights, enhancement, Swift, Kotlin, question, algorithm, dependencies, documentation, TypeScript, C, website, needs reproduction, help wanted, good first issue, bug, wontfix, invalid, duplicate, JavaScript"

[Setup Multi-Output Device]( 2. In `Audio MIDI Setup` `Audio Devices` right-click on the newly created Multi-Output and select ""Use This Device For Sound Output"" 3. Open digital audio workstation (DAW) such as GarageBand and set input device to ""BlackHole"" 4. Set track to input from channel 1-2 5. Play audio from another application and monitor or record in your DAW ### Route Audio Between Applications 1. Set output driver to ""BlackHole"" in sending application 2. Output audio to any channel 3. Open receiving application and set input device to ""BlackHole"" 4. Input audio from the corresponding output channels ## Developer Guides ### A license is required for all non-GPLv3 projects Please support our hard work and continued development. To request a license [contact Existential Audio](mailto:devinroth@existential.audio). ### Build & Install After building, to install BlackHole: 1. Copy or move the built `BlackHoleXch.driver` bundle to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL` 2. Restart CoreAudio using `sudo launchctl kickstart -kp system/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod` ### Customizing BlackHole The following pre-compiler constants may be used to easily customize a build of BlackHole. ``` kDriver_Name kPlugIn_BundleID kPlugIn_Icon kDevice_Name kDevice_IsHidden kDevice_HasInput kDevice_HasOutput kDevice2_Name kDevice2_IsHidden kDevice2_HasInput kDevice2_HasOutput kLatency_Frame_Size kNumber_Of_Channels kSampleRates ``` They can be specified at build time with `xcodebuild` using `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`. Example: ```bash xcodebuild \ -project BlackHole.xcodeproj \ GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS='$GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS kSomeConstant=value' ``` Be sure to escape any quotation marks when using strings. ### Renaming BlackHole To customize BlackHole it is required to change the following constants. - `kDriver_Name` - `kPlugIn_BundleID` (note that this must match the target bundleID) - `kPlugIn_Icon` These can specified as pre-compiler constants using ```xcodebuild```. ```bash driverName=""BlackHole"" bundleID=""audio.existential.BlackHole"" icon=""BlackHole.icns"" xcodebuild \ -project BlackHole.xcodeproj \ -configuration Release \ PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=$bundleID \ GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS='$GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS kDriver_Name=\""'$driverName'\"" kPlugIn_BundleID=\""'$bundleID'\"" kPlugIn_Icon=\""'$icon'\""' ``` ### Customizing Channels, Latency, and Sample Rates `kNumber_Of_Channels` is used to set the number of channels. Be careful when specifying high channel counts. Although BlackHole is designed to be extremely efficient at higher channel counts it's possible that your computer might not be able to keep up. Sample rates play a roll as well. Don't use high sample rates with a high number of channels. Some applications don't know how to handle high channel counts. Proceed with caution. `kLatency_Frame_Size` is how much time in frames that the driver has to process incoming and outgoing audio. It can be used to delay the audio inside of BlackHole up to a maximum of 65536 frames. This may be helpful if using BlackHole with a high channel count. `kSampleRates` set the sample rate or sample rates of the audio device. If using multiple sample rates separate each with a comma (`,`). For example: `kSampleRates='44100,48000'`. ### Mirror Device By default BlackHole has a hidden mirrored audio device. The devices may be customized using the following constants. ``` // Original Device kDevice_IsHidden kDevice_HasInput kDevice_HasOutput // Mirrored Device kDevice2_IsHidden kDevice2_HasInput kDevice2_HasOutput ``` When all are set to true a 2nd BlackHole will show up that works exactly the same. The inputs and outputs are mirrored so the outputs from both devices go to the inputs of both devices. This is useful if you need a separate device for input and output. Example ``` // Original Device kDevice_IsHidden=false kDevice_HasInput=true kDevice_HasOutput=false // Mirrored Device kDevice2_IsHidden=false kDevice2_HasInput=false kDevice2_HasOutput=true ``` In this situation we have two BlackHole devices. One will have inputs only and the other will have outputs only. One way to use this in projects is to hide the mirrored device and use it behind the scenes. That way the user will see an input only device while routing audio through to the output behind them scenes. Hidden audio devices can be accessed using `kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice`. ### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment BlackHole can be integrated into your CI/CD. Take a look at the [create_installer.sh]( shell script to see how the installer is built, signed and notarized. ## Feature Requests If you are interested in any of the following features please leave a comment in the linked issue. To request a features not listed please create a new issue. - [Sync Clock with other Audio Devices]( in development see v0.3.0 - [Output Blackhole to other Audio Device]( - [Add Support for AU Plug-ins]( - [Inter-channel routing]( - [Record Directly to File]( - [Configuration Options Menu]( - [Support for Additional Bit Depths]( ## FAQ ### Why isn't BlackHole showing up in the Applications folder? BlackHole is a virtual audio loopback driver. It only shows up in `Audio MIDI Setup`, `Sound Preferences`, or other audio applications. ### How can I listen to the audio and use BlackHole at the same time? See [Setup a Multi-Output Device]( ### What bit depth does BlackHole use, and can I change it? BlackHole uses 32-bit float bit depth since macOS Core Audio natively uses 32-bit at the system level. This provides the broadest compatibility and greatest audio headroom. This format is lossless for up to 24-bit integer. All applications should be able to playback and record audio, and do not require adjusting bit depth at the BlackHole driver level. ### How can I change the volume of a Multi-Output device? Unfortunately macOS does not support changing the volume of a Multi-Output device but you can set the volume of individual devices in Audio MIDI Setup. ### Why is nothing playing through BlackHole? - Check `System Preferences` `Security & Privacy` `Privacy` `Microphone` to make sure your digital audio workstation (DAW) application has microphone access. - Check that the volume is all the way up on BlackHole input and output in ``Audio MIDI Setup``. - If you are using a multi-output device, due to issues with macOS the Built-in Output must be enabled and listed as the top device in the Multi-Output. [See here for details]( ### Why is audio glitching after X minutes when using a multi-output or an aggregate? - You need to enable drift correction for all devices except the Clock Source also known as Master Device or Primary Device. ### Why is the Installer failing? - Certain versions of macOS have a known issue where install packages may fail to install when the install package is located in certain folders. If you downloaded the .pkg file to your Downloads folder, try moving it to the Desktop and open the .pkg again (or vice-versa). ### What Apps Don't Work with Multi-Outputs? Unfortunately multi-outputs can be buggy and some apps won't work with them at all. Here is a list of known ones. If additional incompatible applications are found, please report them by opening an [issue]( - Apple Podcasts - Apple Messages - HDHomeRun ### AirPods with an Aggregate/Multi-Output is not working. The microphone from AirPods runs at a lower sample rate which means it should not be used as the primary/clock device in an Aggregate or Multi-Output device. The solution is to use your built-in speakers (and just mute them) or BlackHole 2ch as the primary/clock device. BlackHole 16ch will not work as the primary since the primary needs to have 2ch. Read [this discussion]( for more details. ### Can I integrate BlackHole into my app? BlackHole is licensed under GPL-3.0. You can use BlackHole as long as your app is also licensed as GPL-3.0. For all other applications please [contact Existential Audio directly](mailto:devinroth@existential.audio). ## Links and Resources ### [MultiSoundChanger]( A small tool for changing sound volume even for aggregate devices cause native sound volume controller can't change volume of aggregate devices ### [BackgroundMusic]( Background Music, a macOS audio utility: automatically pause your music, set individual apps' volumes and record system audio.","560, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Wiki, Security, Insights, wontfix, bug, Blame Apple, setup, pending closure, help wanted, good first issue, enhancement, duplicate, documentation, audio quality, Missing Information"
reactos,reactos/reactos,14155,"['C', 'C++', 'Assembly']","['operating-system', 'c', 'kernel', 'os', 'osdev']","--- ## Quick Links [Website]( [Official chat]( [Wiki]( [Forum]( [Community Discord]( [JIRA Bug Tracker]( [ReactOS Git mirror]( [Testman]( ## What is ReactOS? ReactOS is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system that is compatible with applications and drivers written for the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7). The ReactOS project, although currently focused on Windows Server 2003 compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with Windows Vista and future Windows NT releases. The code of ReactOS is licensed under [GNU GPL 2.0]( ### Product quality warning **ReactOS is currently an Alpha quality operating system.** This means that ReactOS is under heavy development and you have to be ready to encounter some problems. Different things may not work well and it can corrupt the data present on your hard disk. It is HIGHLY recommended to test ReactOS on a virtual machine or on a computer with no sensitive or critical data! ## Building [![rosbewin.badge]][rosbewin.link] [![rosbeunix.badge]][rosbeunix.link] [![coverity.badge]][coverity.link] To build the system it is strongly advised to use the _ReactOS Build Environment (RosBE)._ Up-to-date versions for Windows and for Unix/GNU-Linux are available from our download page at: [""Build Environment""]( Alternatively one can use Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version 2019+. Building with MSVC is covered here: [""Visual Studio or Microsoft Visual C++""]( See [""Building ReactOS""]( article for more details. ### Binaries To build ReactOS you must run the `configure` script in the directory you want to have your build files. Choose `configure.cmd` or `configure.sh` depending on your system. Then run `ninja ` to build a module you want or just `ninja` to build all modules. ### Bootable images To build a bootable CD image run `ninja bootcd` from the build directory. This will create a CD image with a filename `bootcd.iso`. You can always download fresh binary builds of bootable images from the [""Daily builds""]( page. ## Installing By default, ReactOS currently can only be installed on a machine that has a FAT16 or FAT32 partition as the active (bootable) partition. The partition on which ReactOS is to be installed (which may or may not be the bootable partition) must also be formatted as FAT16 or FAT32. ReactOS Setup can format the partitions if needed. Starting with 0.4.10, ReactOS can be installed using the BtrFS file system. But consider this as an experimental feature and thus regressions not triggered on FAT setup may be observed. To install ReactOS from the bootable CD distribution, extract the archive contents. Then burn the CD image, boot from it, and follow the instructions. See [""Installing ReactOS""]( Wiki page or [INSTALL](INSTALL) for more details. ## Testing If you discover a bug in ReactOS search on JIRA first - it might be reported already. If not report the bug providing logs and as much information as possible. See [""File Bugs""]( for a guide. __NOTE:__ The bug tracker is _not_ for discussions.

Try out cloud-based ReactOS development using Gitpod and Docker: []( You can also support ReactOS by [donating]( We rely on our backers to maintain our servers and accelerate development by [hiring full-time devs]( ## More information ReactOS is a Free and Open Source operating system based on the Windows architecture, providing support for existing applications and drivers, and an alternative to the current dominant consumer operating system. It is not another wrapper built on Linux, like WINE. It does not attempt or plan to compete with WINE; in fact, the user-mode part of ReactOS is almost entirely WINE-based and our two teams have cooperated closely in the past. ReactOS is also not ""yet another OS"". It does not attempt to be a third player like any other alternative OS out there. People are not meant to uninstall Linux and use ReactOS instead; ReactOS is a replacement for Windows users who want a Windows replacement that behaves just like Windows.

Add ""Examples in Python ecosystem"" section if you know some. It shows how patterns could be applied to real-world problems. [facade.py](patterns/structural/facade.py) has a good example of detailed description, but sometimes the shorter one as in [template.py](patterns/behavioral/template.py) would suffice. ##### Python 2 compatibility To see Python 2 compatible versions of some patterns please check-out the [legacy]( tag. ##### Update README When everything else is done - update corresponding part of README. ##### Travis CI Please run the following before submitting a patch - `black .` This lints your code. Then either: - `tox` or `tox -e ci37` This runs unit tests. see tox.ini for further details. - If you have a bash compatible shell use `./lint.sh` This script will lint and test your code. This script mirrors the CI pipeline actions. You can also run `flake8` or `pytest` commands manually. Examples can be found in `tox.ini`. ## Contributing via issue triage []( You can triage issues and pull requests which may include reproducing bug reports or asking for vital information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions.

This allows you to access the unreleased features and bug fixes in the main branch. Installation can be made via ```bash pip install colossalai-nightly ``` ### Download From Source > The version of Colossal-AI will be in line with the main branch of the repository. Feel free to raise an issue if you encounter any problems. :) ```shell git clone cd ColossalAI # install colossalai pip install . ``` By default, we do not compile CUDA/C++ kernels. ColossalAI will build them during runtime. If you want to install and enable CUDA kernel fusion (compulsory installation when using fused optimizer): ```shell BUILD_EXT=1 pip install . ``` For Users with CUDA 10.2, you can still build ColossalAI from source. However, you need to manually download the cub library and copy it to the corresponding directory. ```bash # clone the repository git clone cd ColossalAI # download the cub library wget unzip 1.8.0.zip cp -r cub-1.8.0/cub/ colossalai/kernel/cuda_native/csrc/kernels/include/ # install BUILD_EXT=1 pip install . ``` (back to top) ## Use Docker ### Pull from DockerHub You can directly pull the docker image from our [DockerHub page]( The image is automatically uploaded upon release. ### Build On Your Own Run the following command to build a docker image from Dockerfile provided. > Building Colossal-AI from scratch requires GPU support, you need to use Nvidia Docker Runtime as the default when doing `docker build`. More details can be found [here]( > We recommend you install Colossal-AI from our [project page]( directly. ```bash cd ColossalAI docker build -t colossalai ./docker ``` Run the following command to start the docker container in interactive mode. ```bash docker run -ti --gpus all --rm --ipc=host colossalai bash ``` (back to top) ## Community Join the Colossal-AI community on [Forum]( [Slack]( and [WeChat()]( ""qrcode"") to share your suggestions, feedback, and questions with our engineering team. ## Contributing Referring to the successful attempts of [BLOOM]( and [Stable Diffusion]( any and all developers and partners with computing powers, datasets, models are welcome to join and build the Colossal-AI community, making efforts towards the era of big AI models!

However, the best practice for choosing the optimal parallel strategy is still lacking, as it requires domain expertise in both deep learning and parallel computing. The Colossal-AI system addressed the above challenge by introducing a unified interface to scale your sequential code of model training to distributed environments. It supports parallel training methods such as data, pipeline, tensor, and sequence parallelism and is integrated with heterogeneous training and zero redundancy optimizer. Compared to the baseline system, Colossal-AI can achieve up to 2.76 times training speedup on large-scale models.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 52nd International Conference on Parallel Processing}, pages = {766775}, numpages = {10}, keywords = {datasets, gaze detection, text tagging, neural networks}, location = {Salt Lake City, UT, USA}, series = {ICPP '23} } ``` Colossal-AI has been accepted as official tutorial by top conferences [NeurIPS]( [SC]( [AAAI]( [PPoPP]( [CVPR]( [ISC]( [NVIDIA GTC]( ,etc. (back to top)","4.3k, Code, Issues, Pull requests, Discussions, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights, bug, enhancement, documentation, duplicate, tensor-parallel, shardformer, release, colossal-inference, wontfix, welcome contribution, testing, suspended, stale, sequence parallel, question, pipeline-parallel, lazyinit, known issue, invalid, help wanted, good first issue, gemini, example, diffusion, compatibility, colossal-llama2, code reviewing, chatgpt, auto-parallel, DevOps"
